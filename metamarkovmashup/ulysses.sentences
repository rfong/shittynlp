BEGIN NOW -- I --



STATELY, PLUMP BUCK MULLIGAN CAME FROM THE STAIRHEAD, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. END
BEGIN NOW A yellow dressinggown,
ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. END
BEGIN NOW He
held the bowl aloft and intoned:

--INTROIBO AD ALTARE DEI. END
BEGIN NOW Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

--Come up, Kinch! END
BEGIN NOW Come up, you fearful jesuit! END
BEGIN NOW Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. END
BEGIN NOW He faced about
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
awaking mountains. END
BEGIN NOW Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and
shaking his head. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms
on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling
face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured
hair, grained and hued like pale oak. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered
the bowl smartly. END
BEGIN NOW --Back to barracks! END
BEGIN NOW he said sternly. END
BEGIN NOW He added in a preacher's tone:

--For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and
blood and ouns. END
BEGIN NOW Slow music, please. END
BEGIN NOW Shut your eyes, gents. END
BEGIN NOW One moment. END
BEGIN NOW A
little trouble about those white corpuscles. END
BEGIN NOW Silence, all. END
BEGIN NOW He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there
with gold points. END
BEGIN NOW Chrysostomos. END
BEGIN NOW Two strong shrill whistles answered
through the calm. END
BEGIN NOW --Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. END
BEGIN NOW That will do nicely. END
BEGIN NOW Switch off the
current, will you? END
BEGIN NOW He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
about his legs the loose folds of his gown. END
BEGIN NOW The plump shadowed face and
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. END
BEGIN NOW A
pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips. END
BEGIN NOW --The mockery of it! END
BEGIN NOW he said gaily. END
BEGIN NOW Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! END
BEGIN NOW He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he
propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on. END
BEGIN NOW --My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. END
BEGIN NOW But it has a
Hellenic ring, hasn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. END
BEGIN NOW We
must go to Athens. END
BEGIN NOW Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty
quid? END
BEGIN NOW He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:

--Will he come? END
BEGIN NOW The jejune jesuit! END
BEGIN NOW Ceasing, he began to shave with care. END
BEGIN NOW --Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, my love? END
BEGIN NOW --How long is Haines going to stay in this tower? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW --God, isn't he dreadful? END
BEGIN NOW he said frankly. END
BEGIN NOW A ponderous Saxon. END
BEGIN NOW He thinks
you're not a gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW God, these bloody English! END
BEGIN NOW Bursting with money
and indigestion. END
BEGIN NOW Because he comes from Oxford. END
BEGIN NOW You know, Dedalus, you
have the real Oxford manner. END
BEGIN NOW He can't make you out. END
BEGIN NOW O, my name for you is
the best: Kinch, the knife-blade. END
BEGIN NOW He shaved warily over his chin. END
BEGIN NOW --He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Where is
his guncase? END
BEGIN NOW --A woful lunatic! END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Were you in a funk? END
BEGIN NOW --I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. END
BEGIN NOW Out here in the dark
with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
black panther. END
BEGIN NOW You saved men from drowning. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a hero, however. END
BEGIN NOW If
he stays on here I am off. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. END
BEGIN NOW He hopped down
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily. END
BEGIN NOW --Scutter! END
BEGIN NOW he cried thickly. END
BEGIN NOW He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper
pocket, said:

--Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
dirty crumpled handkerchief. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. END
BEGIN NOW Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:

--The bard's noserag! END
BEGIN NOW A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. END
BEGIN NOW You can almost taste it, can't you? END
BEGIN NOW He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
oakpale hair stirring slightly. END
BEGIN NOW --God! END
BEGIN NOW he said quietly. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
mother? END
BEGIN NOW The snotgreen sea. END
BEGIN NOW The scrotumtightening sea. END
BEGIN NOW EPI OINOPA PONTON. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! END
BEGIN NOW I must teach you. END
BEGIN NOW You must read them in the
original. END
BEGIN NOW THALATTA! END
BEGIN NOW THALATTA! END
BEGIN NOW She is our great sweet mother. END
BEGIN NOW Come and
look. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. END
BEGIN NOW Leaning on it he looked
down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
Kingstown. END
BEGIN NOW --Our mighty mother! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's
face. END
BEGIN NOW --The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. END
BEGIN NOW That's why she won't
let me have anything to do with you. END
BEGIN NOW --Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily. END
BEGIN NOW --You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked
you, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW I'm hyperborean as much as you. END
BEGIN NOW But to think of
your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for
her. END
BEGIN NOW And you refused. END
BEGIN NOW There is something sinister in you ... END
BEGIN NOW He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. END
BEGIN NOW A tolerant
smile curled his lips. END
BEGIN NOW --But a lovely mummer! END
BEGIN NOW he murmured to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Kinch, the loveliest
mummer of them all! END
BEGIN NOW He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. END
BEGIN NOW Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. END
BEGIN NOW Silently, in
a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its
loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her
breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
wetted ashes. END
BEGIN NOW Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. END
BEGIN NOW The ring of bay and
skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. END
BEGIN NOW A bowl of white china had stood
beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up
from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade. END
BEGIN NOW --Ah, poor dogsbody! END
BEGIN NOW he said in a kind voice. END
BEGIN NOW I must give you a shirt and
a few noserags. END
BEGIN NOW How are the secondhand breeks? END
BEGIN NOW --They fit well enough, Stephen answered. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip. END
BEGIN NOW --The mockery of it, he said contentedly. END
BEGIN NOW Secondleg they should be. END
BEGIN NOW God
knows what poxy bowsy left them off. END
BEGIN NOW I have a lovely pair with a hair
stripe, grey. END
BEGIN NOW You'll look spiffing in them. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not joking, Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW You
look damn well when you're dressed. END
BEGIN NOW --Thanks, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW I can't wear them if they are grey. END
BEGIN NOW --He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. END
BEGIN NOW Etiquette is etiquette. END
BEGIN NOW He kills his mother but he can't wear grey
trousers. END
BEGIN NOW He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
smooth skin. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
smokeblue mobile eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says
you have g.p.i. END
BEGIN NOW He's up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. END
BEGIN NOW General
paralysis of the insane! END
BEGIN NOW He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad
in sunlight now radiant on the sea. END
BEGIN NOW His curling shaven lips laughed and
the edges of his white glittering teeth. END
BEGIN NOW Laughter seized all his strong
wellknit trunk. END
BEGIN NOW --Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a
crooked crack. END
BEGIN NOW Hair on end. END
BEGIN NOW As he and others see me. END
BEGIN NOW Who chose this face
for me? END
BEGIN NOW This dogsbody to rid of vermin. END
BEGIN NOW It asks me too. END
BEGIN NOW --I pinched it out of the skivvy's room, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW It does her
all right. END
BEGIN NOW The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. END
BEGIN NOW Lead
him not into temptation. END
BEGIN NOW And her name is Ursula. END
BEGIN NOW Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. END
BEGIN NOW If
Wilde were only alive to see you! END
BEGIN NOW Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:

--It is a symbol of Irish art. END
BEGIN NOW The cracked looking-glass of a servant. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him
round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had
thrust them. END
BEGIN NOW --It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? END
BEGIN NOW he said kindly. END
BEGIN NOW God
knows you have more spirit than any of them. END
BEGIN NOW Parried again. END
BEGIN NOW He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. END
BEGIN NOW The
cold steelpen. END
BEGIN NOW --Cracked lookingglass of a servant! END
BEGIN NOW Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs
and touch him for a guinea. END
BEGIN NOW He's stinking with money and thinks you're
not a gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or
some bloody swindle or other. END
BEGIN NOW God, Kinch, if you and I could only work
together we might do something for the island. END
BEGIN NOW Hellenise it. END
BEGIN NOW Cranly's arm. END
BEGIN NOW His arm. END
BEGIN NOW --And to think of your having to beg from these swine. END
BEGIN NOW I'm the only one
that knows what you are. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you trust me more? END
BEGIN NOW What have you up
your nose against me? END
BEGIN NOW Is it Haines? END
BEGIN NOW If he makes any noise here I'll bring
down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive
Kempthorpe. END
BEGIN NOW Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. END
BEGIN NOW Palefaces:
they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. END
BEGIN NOW O, I shall
expire! END
BEGIN NOW Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! END
BEGIN NOW I shall die! END
BEGIN NOW With slit
ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
tailor's shears. END
BEGIN NOW A scared calf's face gilded with marmalade. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want
to be debagged! END
BEGIN NOW Don't you play the giddy ox with me! END
BEGIN NOW Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. END
BEGIN NOW A deaf
gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower on
the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms. END
BEGIN NOW To ourselves ... new paganism ... omphalos. END
BEGIN NOW --Let him stay, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW There's nothing wrong with him except at
night. END
BEGIN NOW --Then what is it? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. END
BEGIN NOW Cough it up. END
BEGIN NOW I'm
quite frank with you. END
BEGIN NOW What have you against me now? END
BEGIN NOW They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the
water like the snout of a sleeping whale. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen freed his arm quietly. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you wish me to tell you? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, what is it? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan answered. END
BEGIN NOW I don't remember anything. END
BEGIN NOW He looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. END
BEGIN NOW A light wind passed his brow,
fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
anxiety in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:

--Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother's
death? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:

--What? END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW I can't remember anything. END
BEGIN NOW I remember only ideas and
sensations. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW What happened in the name of God? END
BEGIN NOW --You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get
more hot water. END
BEGIN NOW Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. END
BEGIN NOW She asked you who was in your room. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW What did I say? END
BEGIN NOW I forget. END
BEGIN NOW --You said, Stephen answered, O, IT'S ONLY DEDALUS WHOSE MOTHER IS
BEASTLY DEAD. END
BEGIN NOW A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
Mulligan's cheek. END
BEGIN NOW --Did I say that? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW What harm is that? END
BEGIN NOW He shook his constraint from him nervously. END
BEGIN NOW --And what is death, he asked, your mother's or yours or my own? END
BEGIN NOW You saw
only your mother die. END
BEGIN NOW I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. END
BEGIN NOW It's a beastly
thing and nothing else. END
BEGIN NOW It simply doesn't matter. END
BEGIN NOW You wouldn't kneel down
to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Because
you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the wrong
way. END
BEGIN NOW To me it's all a mockery and beastly. END
BEGIN NOW Her cerebral lobes are not
functioning. END
BEGIN NOW She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups
off the quilt. END
BEGIN NOW Humour her till it's over. END
BEGIN NOW You crossed her last wish in
death and yet you sulk with me because I don't whinge like some hired
mute from Lalouette's. END
BEGIN NOW Absurd! END
BEGIN NOW I suppose I did say it. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't mean to
offend the memory of your mother. END
BEGIN NOW He had spoken himself into boldness. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds
which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:

--I am not thinking of the offence to my mother. END
BEGIN NOW --Of what then? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Of the offence to me, Stephen answered. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel. END
BEGIN NOW --O, an impossible person! END
BEGIN NOW he exclaimed. END
BEGIN NOW He walked off quickly round the parapet. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen stood at his post,
gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. END
BEGIN NOW Sea and headland now grew
dim. END
BEGIN NOW Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt
the fever of his cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW A voice within the tower called loudly:

--Are you up there, Mulligan? END
BEGIN NOW --I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered. END
BEGIN NOW He turned towards Stephen and said:

--Look at the sea. END
BEGIN NOW What does it care about offences? END
BEGIN NOW Chuck Loyola, Kinch,
and come on down. END
BEGIN NOW The Sassenach wants his morning rashers. END
BEGIN NOW His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
with the roof:

--Don't mope over it all day, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I'm inconsequent. END
BEGIN NOW Give up the
moody brooding. END
BEGIN NOW His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the
stairhead:


    AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD
   UPON LOVE'S BITTER MYSTERY
   FOR FERGUS RULES THE BRAZEN CARS. END
BEGIN NOW Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
stairhead seaward where he gazed. END
BEGIN NOW Inshore and farther out the mirror of
water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. END
BEGIN NOW White breast of the
dim sea. END
BEGIN NOW The twining stresses, two by two. END
BEGIN NOW A hand plucking the
harpstrings, merging their twining chords. END
BEGIN NOW Wavewhite wedded words
shimmering on the dim tide. END
BEGIN NOW A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
deeper green. END
BEGIN NOW It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. END
BEGIN NOW Fergus' song:
I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. END
BEGIN NOW Her door
was open: she wanted to hear my music. END
BEGIN NOW Silent with awe and pity I went to
her bedside. END
BEGIN NOW She was crying in her wretched bed. END
BEGIN NOW For those words,
Stephen: love's bitter mystery. END
BEGIN NOW Where now? END
BEGIN NOW Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a
gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. END
BEGIN NOW A birdcage hung in the sunny
window of her house when she was a girl. END
BEGIN NOW She heard old Royce sing in the
pantomime of TURKO THE TERRIBLE and laughed with others when he sang:


    I AM THE BOY
    THAT CAN ENJOY
    INVISIBILITY. END
BEGIN NOW Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed. END
BEGIN NOW AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD. END
BEGIN NOW Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. END
BEGIN NOW Memories beset his
brooding brain. END
BEGIN NOW Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
approached the sacrament. END
BEGIN NOW A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. END
BEGIN NOW Her shapely
fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's
shirts. END
BEGIN NOW In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes. END
BEGIN NOW Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. END
BEGIN NOW On me
alone. END
BEGIN NOW The ghostcandle to light her agony. END
BEGIN NOW Ghostly light on the tortured
face. END
BEGIN NOW Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on
their knees. END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes on me to strike me down. END
BEGIN NOW LILIATA RUTILANTIUM TE
CONFESSORUM TURMA CIRCUMDET: IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM CHORUS EXCIPIAT. END
BEGIN NOW Ghoul! END
BEGIN NOW Chewer of corpses! END
BEGIN NOW No, mother! END
BEGIN NOW Let me be and let me live. END
BEGIN NOW --Kinch ahoy! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. END
BEGIN NOW It came nearer up the
staircase, calling again. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry,
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words. END
BEGIN NOW --Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. END
BEGIN NOW Breakfast is ready. END
BEGIN NOW Haines is
apologising for waking us last night. END
BEGIN NOW It's all right. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm coming, Stephen said, turning. END
BEGIN NOW --Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW For my sake and for all our
sakes. END
BEGIN NOW His head disappeared and reappeared. END
BEGIN NOW --I told him your symbol of Irish art. END
BEGIN NOW He says it's very clever. END
BEGIN NOW Touch
him for a quid, will you? END
BEGIN NOW A guinea, I mean. END
BEGIN NOW --I get paid this morning, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW --The school kip? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW How much? END
BEGIN NOW Four quid? END
BEGIN NOW Lend us one. END
BEGIN NOW --If you want it, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW --Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. END
BEGIN NOW We'll have a
glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. END
BEGIN NOW Four omnipotent sovereigns. END
BEGIN NOW He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
tune with a Cockney accent:


    O, WON'T WE HAVE A MERRY TIME,
    DRINKING WHISKY, BEER AND WINE! END
BEGIN NOW ON CORONATION,
    CORONATION DAY! END
BEGIN NOW O, WON'T WE HAVE A MERRY TIME
    ON CORONATION DAY! END
BEGIN NOW Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. END
BEGIN NOW The nickel shavingbowl shone,
forgotten, on the parapet. END
BEGIN NOW Why should I bring it down? END
BEGIN NOW Or leave it there
all day, forgotten friendship? END
BEGIN NOW He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. END
BEGIN NOW So
I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. END
BEGIN NOW I am another now and yet
the same. END
BEGIN NOW A servant too. END
BEGIN NOW A server of a servant. END
BEGIN NOW In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form
moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
yellow glow. END
BEGIN NOW Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning. END
BEGIN NOW --We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Haines, open that door, will you? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. END
BEGIN NOW A tall figure rose from the
hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
the inner doors. END
BEGIN NOW --Have you the key? END
BEGIN NOW a voice asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Janey Mack, I'm choked! END
BEGIN NOW He howled, without looking up from the fire:

--Kinch! END
BEGIN NOW --It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward. END
BEGIN NOW The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set
ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. END
BEGIN NOW Haines stood at the doorway,
looking out. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down
to wait. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. END
BEGIN NOW Then he
carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down
heavily and sighed with relief. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when ... END
BEGIN NOW But, hush! END
BEGIN NOW Not a
word more on that subject! END
BEGIN NOW Kinch, wake up! END
BEGIN NOW Bread, butter, honey. END
BEGIN NOW Haines,
come in. END
BEGIN NOW The grub is ready. END
BEGIN NOW Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. END
BEGIN NOW Where's the sugar? END
BEGIN NOW O, jay, there's no milk. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
the locker. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet. END
BEGIN NOW --What sort of a kip is this? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW I told her to come after eight. END
BEGIN NOW --We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. END
BEGIN NOW There's a lemon in the
locker. END
BEGIN NOW --O, damn you and your Paris fads! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW I want Sandycove
milk. END
BEGIN NOW Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:

--That woman is coming up with the milk. END
BEGIN NOW --The blessings of God on you! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
chair. END
BEGIN NOW Sit down. END
BEGIN NOW Pour out the tea there. END
BEGIN NOW The sugar is in the bag. END
BEGIN NOW Here, I
can't go fumbling at the damned eggs. END
BEGIN NOW He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates,
saying:

--IN NOMINE PATRIS ET FILII ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. END
BEGIN NOW Haines sat down to pour out the tea. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. END
BEGIN NOW But, I say, Mulligan, you do
make strong tea, don't you? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's
wheedling voice:

--When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. END
BEGIN NOW And when I
makes water I makes water. END
BEGIN NOW --By Jove, it is tea, Haines said. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:

--SO I DO, MRS CAHILL, says she. END
BEGIN NOW BEGOB, MA'AM, says Mrs Cahill, GOD SEND
YOU DON'T MAKE THEM IN THE ONE POT. END
BEGIN NOW He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife. END
BEGIN NOW --That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. END
BEGIN NOW Five lines
of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
Dundrum. END
BEGIN NOW Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind. END
BEGIN NOW He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
brows:

--Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken of
in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads? END
BEGIN NOW --I doubt it, said Stephen gravely. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you now? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. END
BEGIN NOW Your reasons, pray? END
BEGIN NOW --I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
Mabinogion. END
BEGIN NOW Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's face smiled with delight. END
BEGIN NOW --Charming! END
BEGIN NOW he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and
blinking his eyes pleasantly. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think she was? END
BEGIN NOW Quite charming! END
BEGIN NOW Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:


  --FOR OLD MARY ANN
    SHE DOESN'T CARE A DAMN. END
BEGIN NOW BUT, HISING UP HER PETTICOATS ... END
BEGIN NOW He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. END
BEGIN NOW The doorway was darkened by an entering form. END
BEGIN NOW --The milk, sir! END
BEGIN NOW --Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Kinch, get the jug. END
BEGIN NOW An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow. END
BEGIN NOW --That's a lovely morning, sir, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Glory be to God. END
BEGIN NOW --To whom? END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan said, glancing at her. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, to be sure! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker. END
BEGIN NOW --The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
the collector of prepuces. END
BEGIN NOW --How much, sir? END
BEGIN NOW asked the old woman. END
BEGIN NOW --A quart, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
milk, not hers. END
BEGIN NOW Old shrunken paps. END
BEGIN NOW She poured again a measureful and a
tilly. END
BEGIN NOW Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a
messenger. END
BEGIN NOW She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. END
BEGIN NOW Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her
toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. END
BEGIN NOW They lowed
about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. END
BEGIN NOW Silk of the kine and poor old
woman, names given her in old times. END
BEGIN NOW A wandering crone, lowly form of an
immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common
cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. END
BEGIN NOW To serve or to upbraid,
whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour. END
BEGIN NOW --It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups. END
BEGIN NOW --Taste it, sir, she said. END
BEGIN NOW He drank at her bidding. END
BEGIN NOW --If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
guts. END
BEGIN NOW Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with
dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits. END
BEGIN NOW --Are you a medical student, sir? END
BEGIN NOW the old woman asked. END
BEGIN NOW --I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan answered. END
BEGIN NOW --Look at that now, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen listened in scornful silence. END
BEGIN NOW She bows her old head to a voice
that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
slights. END
BEGIN NOW To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is
of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in God's
likeness, the serpent's prey. END
BEGIN NOW And to the loud voice that now bids her be
silent with wondering unsteady eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you understand what he says? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked her. END
BEGIN NOW --Is it French you are talking, sir? END
BEGIN NOW the old woman said to Haines. END
BEGIN NOW Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently. END
BEGIN NOW --Irish, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Is there Gaelic on you? END
BEGIN NOW --I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. END
BEGIN NOW Are you from the
west, sir? END
BEGIN NOW --I am an Englishman, Haines answered. END
BEGIN NOW --He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish
in Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW --Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak the
language myself. END
BEGIN NOW I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows. END
BEGIN NOW --Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful entirely. END
BEGIN NOW Fill
us out some more tea, Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW Would you like a cup, ma'am? END
BEGIN NOW --No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go. END
BEGIN NOW Haines said to her:

--Have you your bill? END
BEGIN NOW We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen filled again the three cups. END
BEGIN NOW --Bill, sir? END
BEGIN NOW she said, halting. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it's seven mornings a pint at
twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. END
BEGIN NOW That's a
shilling and one and two is two and two, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his
trouser pockets. END
BEGIN NOW --Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick
rich milk. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his
fingers and cried:

--A miracle! END
BEGIN NOW He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:

--Ask nothing more of me, sweet. END
BEGIN NOW All I can give you I give. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand. END
BEGIN NOW --We'll owe twopence, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. END
BEGIN NOW Time enough. END
BEGIN NOW Good morning,
sir. END
BEGIN NOW She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant:


  --HEART OF MY HEART, WERE IT MORE,
    MORE WOULD BE LAID AT YOUR FEET. END
BEGIN NOW He turned to Stephen and said:

--Seriously, Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW I'm stony. END
BEGIN NOW Hurry out to your school kip and bring
us back some money. END
BEGIN NOW Today the bards must drink and junket. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland
expects that every man this day will do his duty. END
BEGIN NOW --That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
national library today. END
BEGIN NOW --Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:

--Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch? END
BEGIN NOW Then he said to Haines:

--The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month. END
BEGIN NOW --All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf. END
BEGIN NOW Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:

--I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me. END
BEGIN NOW Speaking to me. END
BEGIN NOW They wash and tub and scrub. END
BEGIN NOW Agenbite of inwit. END
BEGIN NOW Conscience. END
BEGIN NOW Yet here's a spot. END
BEGIN NOW --That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
of Irish art is deuced good. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and said with warmth
of tone:

--Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW I was just
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in. END
BEGIN NOW --Would I make any money by it? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the
hammock, said:

--I don't know, I'm sure. END
BEGIN NOW He strolled out to the doorway. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and
said with coarse vigour:

--You put your hoof in it now. END
BEGIN NOW What did you say that for? END
BEGIN NOW --Well? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW The problem is to get money. END
BEGIN NOW From whom? END
BEGIN NOW From the
milkwoman or from him. END
BEGIN NOW It's a toss up, I think. END
BEGIN NOW --I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes. END
BEGIN NOW --I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm. END
BEGIN NOW --From me, Kinch, he said. END
BEGIN NOW In a suddenly changed tone he added:

--To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. END
BEGIN NOW Damn all else they
are good for. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you play them as I do? END
BEGIN NOW To hell with them all. END
BEGIN NOW Let
us get out of the kip. END
BEGIN NOW He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
resignedly:

--Mulligan is stripped of his garments. END
BEGIN NOW He emptied his pockets on to the table. END
BEGIN NOW --There's your snotrag, he said. END
BEGIN NOW And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. END
BEGIN NOW His hands plunged and
rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. END
BEGIN NOW God,
we'll simply have to dress the character. END
BEGIN NOW I want puce gloves and green
boots. END
BEGIN NOW Contradiction. END
BEGIN NOW Do I contradict myself? END
BEGIN NOW Very well then, I
contradict myself. END
BEGIN NOW Mercurial Malachi. END
BEGIN NOW A limp black missile flew out of
his talking hands. END
BEGIN NOW --And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen picked it up and put it on. END
BEGIN NOW Haines called to them from the
doorway:

--Are you coming, you fellows? END
BEGIN NOW --I'm ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. END
BEGIN NOW Come out,
Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW You have eaten all we left, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Resigned he passed out with
grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:

--And going forth he met Butterly. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it. END
BEGIN NOW He put the huge key in his inner pocket. END
BEGIN NOW At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:

--Did you bring the key? END
BEGIN NOW --I have it, Stephen said, preceding them. END
BEGIN NOW He walked on. END
BEGIN NOW Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses. END
BEGIN NOW --Down, sir! END
BEGIN NOW How dare you, sir! END
BEGIN NOW Haines asked:

--Do you pay rent for this tower? END
BEGIN NOW --Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW --To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:

--Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. END
BEGIN NOW Martello you call it? END
BEGIN NOW --Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
the sea. END
BEGIN NOW But ours is the OMPHALOS. END
BEGIN NOW --What is your idea of Hamlet? END
BEGIN NOW Haines asked Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW --No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas
and the fifty-five reasons he has made out to prop it up. END
BEGIN NOW Wait till I have
a few pints in me first. END
BEGIN NOW He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:

--You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you? END
BEGIN NOW --It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer. END
BEGIN NOW --You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. END
BEGIN NOW Is it some paradox? END
BEGIN NOW --Pooh! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. END
BEGIN NOW It's quite simple. END
BEGIN NOW He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is
Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
father. END
BEGIN NOW --What? END
BEGIN NOW Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW He himself? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
loose laughter, said to Stephen's ear:

--O, shade of Kinch the elder! END
BEGIN NOW Japhet in search of a father! END
BEGIN NOW --We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. END
BEGIN NOW And it is
rather long to tell. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands. END
BEGIN NOW --The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower
and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. END
BEGIN NOW THAT BEETLES O'ER
HIS BASE INTO THE SEA, ISN'T IT? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan turned suddenly. END
BEGIN NOW for an instant towards Stephen but did not
speak. END
BEGIN NOW In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap
dusty mourning between their gay attires. END
BEGIN NOW --It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. END
BEGIN NOW The seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking
by the Muglins. END
BEGIN NOW --I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. END
BEGIN NOW The Father and the Son idea. END
BEGIN NOW The Son striving to be atoned with the
Father. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. END
BEGIN NOW He looked at
them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. END
BEGIN NOW He moved a
doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began
to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:


  --I'M THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD. END
BEGIN NOW MY MOTHER'S A JEW, MY FATHER'S A BIRD. END
BEGIN NOW WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE. END
BEGIN NOW SO HERE'S TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARY. END
BEGIN NOW He held up a forefinger of warning. END
BEGIN NOW --IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMN'T DIVINE
    HE'LL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN I'M MAKING THE WINE
    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN
    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAIN. END
BEGIN NOW He tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running forward
to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or
wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:


  --GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE! END
BEGIN NOW WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID
    AND TELL TOM, DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT'S BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY
    AND OLIVET'S BREEZY ... GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE! END
BEGIN NOW He capered before them down towards the forty-foot hole, fluttering his
winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in the fresh wind
that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries. END
BEGIN NOW Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
said:

--We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW He's rather blasphemous. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a
believer myself, that is to say. END
BEGIN NOW Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
it somehow, doesn't it? END
BEGIN NOW What did he call it? END
BEGIN NOW Joseph the Joiner? END
BEGIN NOW --The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered. END
BEGIN NOW --O, Haines said, you have heard it before? END
BEGIN NOW --Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily. END
BEGIN NOW --You're not a believer, are you? END
BEGIN NOW Haines asked. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, a believer in the
narrow sense of the word. END
BEGIN NOW Creation from nothing and miracles and a
personal God. END
BEGIN NOW --There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green
stone. END
BEGIN NOW He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it. END
BEGIN NOW --Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. END
BEGIN NOW He put it back in his
sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
towards Stephen in the shell of his hands. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. END
BEGIN NOW Either you believe or
you don't, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a
personal God. END
BEGIN NOW You don't stand for that, I suppose? END
BEGIN NOW --You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
example of free thought. END
BEGIN NOW He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side. END
BEGIN NOW Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. END
BEGIN NOW My
familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! END
BEGIN NOW A wavering line along
the path. END
BEGIN NOW They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW He wants
that key. END
BEGIN NOW It is mine. END
BEGIN NOW I paid the rent. END
BEGIN NOW Now I eat his salt bread. END
BEGIN NOW Give him
the key too. END
BEGIN NOW All. END
BEGIN NOW He will ask for it. END
BEGIN NOW That was in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --After all, Haines began ...

Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not
all unkind. END
BEGIN NOW --After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. END
BEGIN NOW You are your
own master, it seems to me. END
BEGIN NOW --I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian. END
BEGIN NOW --Italian? END
BEGIN NOW Haines said. END
BEGIN NOW A crazy queen, old and jealous. END
BEGIN NOW Kneel down before me. END
BEGIN NOW --And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs. END
BEGIN NOW --Italian? END
BEGIN NOW Haines said again. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW --The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church. END
BEGIN NOW Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke. END
BEGIN NOW --I can quite understand that, he said calmly. END
BEGIN NOW An Irishman must think
like that, I daresay. END
BEGIN NOW We feel in England that we have treated you rather
unfairly. END
BEGIN NOW It seems history is to blame. END
BEGIN NOW The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph of
their brazen bells: ET UNAM SANCTAM CATHOLICAM ET APOSTOLICAM ECCLESIAM:
the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts,
a chemistry of stars. END
BEGIN NOW Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope
Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and
behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and
menaced her heresiarchs. END
BEGIN NOW A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry:
Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius,
warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the
Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ's terrene body, and the subtle
African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own
Son. END
BEGIN NOW Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger. END
BEGIN NOW Idle mockery. END
BEGIN NOW The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a
menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the
church, Michael's host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with
their lances and their shields. END
BEGIN NOW Hear, hear! END
BEGIN NOW Prolonged applause. END
BEGIN NOW ZUT! END
BEGIN NOW NOM DE DIEU! END
BEGIN NOW --Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines's voice said, and I feel as one. END
BEGIN NOW I
don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. END
BEGIN NOW That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now. END
BEGIN NOW Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman. END
BEGIN NOW --She's making for Bullock harbour. END
BEGIN NOW The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain. END
BEGIN NOW --There's five fathoms out there, he said. END
BEGIN NOW It'll be swept up that way
when the tide comes in about one. END
BEGIN NOW It's nine days today. END
BEGIN NOW The man that was drowned. END
BEGIN NOW A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for
a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. END
BEGIN NOW Here I am. END
BEGIN NOW They followed the winding path down to the creek. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan stood on
a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW A
young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his
green legs in the deep jelly of the water. END
BEGIN NOW --Is the brother with you, Malachi? END
BEGIN NOW --Down in Westmeath. END
BEGIN NOW With the Bannons. END
BEGIN NOW --Still there? END
BEGIN NOW I got a card from Bannon. END
BEGIN NOW Says he found a sweet young
thing down there. END
BEGIN NOW Photo girl he calls her. END
BEGIN NOW --Snapshot, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Brief exposure. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. END
BEGIN NOW An elderly man shot up near
the spur of rock a blowing red face. END
BEGIN NOW He scrambled up by the stones, water
glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling
over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging
loincloth. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
and breastbone. END
BEGIN NOW --Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
rock. END
BEGIN NOW Chucked medicine and going in for the army. END
BEGIN NOW --Ah, go to God! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW --Going over next week to stew. END
BEGIN NOW You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes. END
BEGIN NOW --Spooning with him last night on the pier. END
BEGIN NOW The father is rotto with
money. END
BEGIN NOW --Is she up the pole? END
BEGIN NOW --Better ask Seymour that. END
BEGIN NOW --Seymour a bleeding officer! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
tritely:

--Redheaded women buck like goats. END
BEGIN NOW He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt. END
BEGIN NOW --My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. END
BEGIN NOW I'm the UBERMENSCH. END
BEGIN NOW Toothless Kinch
and I, the supermen. END
BEGIN NOW He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay. END
BEGIN NOW --Are you going in here, Malachi? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Make room in the bed. END
BEGIN NOW The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. END
BEGIN NOW Haines sat down on a
stone, smoking. END
BEGIN NOW --Are you not coming in? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Later on, Haines said. END
BEGIN NOW Not on my breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen turned away. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm going, Mulligan, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen handed him the key. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes. END
BEGIN NOW --And twopence, he said, for a pint. END
BEGIN NOW Throw it there. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. END
BEGIN NOW Dressing, undressing. END
BEGIN NOW Buck
Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:

--He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Thus spake
Zarathustra. END
BEGIN NOW His plump body plunged. END
BEGIN NOW --We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path
and smiling at wild Irish. END
BEGIN NOW Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon. END
BEGIN NOW --The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. END
BEGIN NOW Half twelve. END
BEGIN NOW --Good, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW He walked along the upwardcurving path. END
BEGIN NOW LILIATA RUTILANTIUM. END
BEGIN NOW TURMA CIRCUMDET. END
BEGIN NOW IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM. END
BEGIN NOW The priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. END
BEGIN NOW I will
not sleep here tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Home also I cannot go. END
BEGIN NOW A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. END
BEGIN NOW Turning
the curve he waved his hand. END
BEGIN NOW It called again. END
BEGIN NOW A sleek brown head, a
seal's, far out on the water, round. END
BEGIN NOW Usurper. END
BEGIN NOW * * * * * * *


--You, Cochrane, what city sent for him? END
BEGIN NOW --Tarentum, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --Very good. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW --There was a battle, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --Very good. END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW The boy's blank face asked the blank window. END
BEGIN NOW Fabled by the daughters of memory. END
BEGIN NOW And yet it was in some way if not as
memory fabled it. END
BEGIN NOW A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake's wings of
excess. END
BEGIN NOW I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
masonry, and time one livid final flame. END
BEGIN NOW What's left us then? END
BEGIN NOW --I forget the place, sir. END
BEGIN NOW 279 B. C.

--Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred
book. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW And he said: ANOTHER VICTORY LIKE THAT AND WE ARE DONE FOR. END
BEGIN NOW That phrase the world had remembered. END
BEGIN NOW A dull ease of the mind. END
BEGIN NOW From a
hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
leaned upon his spear. END
BEGIN NOW Any general to any officers. END
BEGIN NOW They lend ear. END
BEGIN NOW --You, Armstrong, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW What was the end of Pyrrhus? END
BEGIN NOW --End of Pyrrhus, sir? END
BEGIN NOW --I know, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Ask me, sir, Comyn said. END
BEGIN NOW --Wait. END
BEGIN NOW You, Armstrong. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know anything about Pyrrhus? END
BEGIN NOW A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. END
BEGIN NOW He curled them
between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. END
BEGIN NOW Crumbs adhered to
the tissue of his lips. END
BEGIN NOW A sweetened boy's breath. END
BEGIN NOW Welloff people, proud
that their eldest son was in the navy. END
BEGIN NOW Vico road, Dalkey. END
BEGIN NOW --Pyrrhus, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Pyrrhus, a pier. END
BEGIN NOW All laughed. END
BEGIN NOW Mirthless high malicious laughter. END
BEGIN NOW Armstrong looked round at
his classmates, silly glee in profile. END
BEGIN NOW In a moment they will laugh more
loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay. END
BEGIN NOW --Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,
what is a pier. END
BEGIN NOW --A pier, sir, Armstrong said. END
BEGIN NOW A thing out in the water. END
BEGIN NOW A kind of a
bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Kingstown pier, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. END
BEGIN NOW Two in the back bench
whispered. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. END
BEGIN NOW All. END
BEGIN NOW With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. END
BEGIN NOW Their likes:
their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering
in the struggle. END
BEGIN NOW --Kingstown pier, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, a disappointed bridge. END
BEGIN NOW The words troubled their gaze. END
BEGIN NOW --How, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Comyn asked. END
BEGIN NOW A bridge is across a river. END
BEGIN NOW For Haines's chapbook. END
BEGIN NOW No-one here to hear. END
BEGIN NOW Tonight deftly amid wild
drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. END
BEGIN NOW What then? END
BEGIN NOW A
jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
clement master's praise. END
BEGIN NOW Why had they chosen all that part? END
BEGIN NOW Not wholly
for the smooth caress. END
BEGIN NOW For them too history was a tale like any other too
often heard, their land a pawnshop. END
BEGIN NOW Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
been knifed to death. END
BEGIN NOW They are not to be thought away. END
BEGIN NOW Time has branded
them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
possibilities they have ousted. END
BEGIN NOW But can those have been possible seeing
that they never were? END
BEGIN NOW Or was that only possible which came to pass? END
BEGIN NOW Weave, weaver of the wind. END
BEGIN NOW --Tell us a story, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --O, do, sir. END
BEGIN NOW A ghoststory. END
BEGIN NOW --Where do you begin in this? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked, opening another book. END
BEGIN NOW --WEEP NO MORE, Comyn said. END
BEGIN NOW --Go on then, Talbot. END
BEGIN NOW --And the story, sir? END
BEGIN NOW --After, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Go on, Talbot. END
BEGIN NOW A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of
his satchel. END
BEGIN NOW He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:


  --WEEP NO MORE, WOFUL SHEPHERDS, WEEP NO MORE
    FOR LYCIDAS, YOUR SORROW, IS NOT DEAD,
    SUNK THOUGH HE BE BENEATH THE WATERY FLOOR ... END
BEGIN NOW It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. END
BEGIN NOW Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he
had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. END
BEGIN NOW By his elbow a
delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. END
BEGIN NOW Fed and feeding brains
about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in
my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of
brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. END
BEGIN NOW Thought is the thought of
thought. END
BEGIN NOW Tranquil brightness. END
BEGIN NOW The soul is in a manner all that is: the
soul is the form of forms. END
BEGIN NOW Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of
forms. END
BEGIN NOW Talbot repeated:


  --THROUGH THE DEAR MIGHT OF HIM THAT WALKED THE WAVES,
    THROUGH THE DEAR MIGHT ...


--Turn over, Stephen said quietly. END
BEGIN NOW I don't see anything. END
BEGIN NOW --What, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Talbot asked simply, bending forward. END
BEGIN NOW His hand turned the page over. END
BEGIN NOW He leaned back and went on again,
having just remembered. END
BEGIN NOW Of him that walked the waves. END
BEGIN NOW Here also over
these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips
and on mine. END
BEGIN NOW It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
tribute. END
BEGIN NOW To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's. END
BEGIN NOW A long look
from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church's
looms. END
BEGIN NOW Ay. END
BEGIN NOW RIDDLE ME, RIDDLE ME, RANDY RO. END
BEGIN NOW MY FATHER GAVE ME SEEDS TO SOW. END
BEGIN NOW Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel. END
BEGIN NOW --Have I heard all? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Hockey at ten, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --Half day, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Thursday. END
BEGIN NOW --Who can answer a riddle? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. END
BEGIN NOW Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling
gaily:

--A riddle, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Ask me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --O, ask me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --A hard one, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --This is the riddle, Stephen said:


    THE COCK CREW,
    THE SKY WAS BLUE:
    THE BELLS IN HEAVEN
    WERE STRIKING ELEVEN. END
BEGIN NOW 'TIS TIME FOR THIS POOR SOUL
    TO GO TO HEAVEN. END
BEGIN NOW What is that? END
BEGIN NOW --What, sir? END
BEGIN NOW --Again, sir. END
BEGIN NOW We didn't hear. END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. END
BEGIN NOW After a silence
Cochrane said:

--What is it, sir? END
BEGIN NOW We give it up. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, his throat itching, answered:

--The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush. END
BEGIN NOW He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
echoed dismay. END
BEGIN NOW A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:

--Hockey! END
BEGIN NOW They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. END
BEGIN NOW Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks
and clamour of their boots and tongues. END
BEGIN NOW Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an
open copybook. END
BEGIN NOW His thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness of
unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. END
BEGIN NOW On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped,
recent and damp as a snail's bed. END
BEGIN NOW He held out his copybook. END
BEGIN NOW The word SUMS was written on the
headline. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature
with blind loops and a blot. END
BEGIN NOW Cyril Sargent: his name and seal. END
BEGIN NOW --Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to
you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen touched the edges of the book. END
BEGIN NOW Futility. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you understand how to do them now? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy said I was to
copy them off the board, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --Can you do them. END
BEGIN NOW yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW --No, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snail's
bed. END
BEGIN NOW Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. END
BEGIN NOW But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a
squashed boneless snail. END
BEGIN NOW She had loved his weak watery blood drained from
her own. END
BEGIN NOW Was that then real? END
BEGIN NOW The only true thing in life? END
BEGIN NOW His mother's
prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. END
BEGIN NOW She was no
more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of
rosewood and wetted ashes. END
BEGIN NOW She had saved him from being trampled
underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. END
BEGIN NOW A poor soul gone to heaven:
and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur,
with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the
earth, listened, scraped and scraped. END
BEGIN NOW Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. END
BEGIN NOW He proves by
algebra that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather. END
BEGIN NOW Sargent peered
askance through his slanted glasses. END
BEGIN NOW Hockeysticks rattled in the
lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field. END
BEGIN NOW Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery
of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. END
BEGIN NOW Give hands,
traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. END
BEGIN NOW Gone too from
the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and
movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the
world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not
comprehend. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you understand now? END
BEGIN NOW Can you work the second for yourself? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. END
BEGIN NOW Waiting always for a
word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue
of shame flickering behind his dull skin. END
BEGIN NOW AMOR MATRIS: subjective and
objective genitive. END
BEGIN NOW With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him
and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands. END
BEGIN NOW Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. END
BEGIN NOW My
childhood bends beside me. END
BEGIN NOW Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
lightly. END
BEGIN NOW Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Secrets, silent, stony
sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned. END
BEGIN NOW The sum was done. END
BEGIN NOW --It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, Sargent answered. END
BEGIN NOW He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench. END
BEGIN NOW --You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as
he followed towards the door the boy's graceless form. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield. END
BEGIN NOW --Sargent! END
BEGIN NOW --Run on, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy is calling you. END
BEGIN NOW He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the
scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife. END
BEGIN NOW They were sorted in teams
and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. END
BEGIN NOW When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to
him. END
BEGIN NOW He turned his angry white moustache. END
BEGIN NOW --What is it now? END
BEGIN NOW he cried continually without listening. END
BEGIN NOW --Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW --Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
order here. END
BEGIN NOW And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice
cried sternly:

--What is the matter? END
BEGIN NOW What is it now? END
BEGIN NOW Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms
closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed
head. END
BEGIN NOW Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded
leather of its chairs. END
BEGIN NOW As on the first day he bargained with me here. END
BEGIN NOW As
it was in the beginning, is now. END
BEGIN NOW On the sideboard the tray of Stuart
coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. END
BEGIN NOW And snug in their
spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to
all the gentiles: world without end. END
BEGIN NOW A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. END
BEGIN NOW Blowing out his
rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table. END
BEGIN NOW --First, our little financial settlement, he said. END
BEGIN NOW He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. END
BEGIN NOW It
slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid
them carefully on the table. END
BEGIN NOW --Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away. END
BEGIN NOW And now his strongroom for the gold. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen's embarrassed hand
moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and
this, the scallop of saint James. END
BEGIN NOW An old pilgrim's hoard, dead treasure,
hollow shells. END
BEGIN NOW A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth. END
BEGIN NOW --Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand. END
BEGIN NOW These are handy things to have. END
BEGIN NOW See. END
BEGIN NOW This is for sovereigns. END
BEGIN NOW This is for
shillings. END
BEGIN NOW Sixpences, halfcrowns. END
BEGIN NOW And here crowns. END
BEGIN NOW See. END
BEGIN NOW He shot from it two crowns and two shillings. END
BEGIN NOW --Three twelve, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I think you'll find that's right. END
BEGIN NOW --Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers. END
BEGIN NOW --No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You have earned it. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. END
BEGIN NOW Symbols
too of beauty and of power. END
BEGIN NOW A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed
and misery. END
BEGIN NOW --Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You'll pull it out somewhere
and lose it. END
BEGIN NOW You just buy one of these machines. END
BEGIN NOW You'll find them very
handy. END
BEGIN NOW Answer something. END
BEGIN NOW --Mine would be often empty, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. END
BEGIN NOW Three
times now. END
BEGIN NOW Three nooses round me here. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW I can break them in this
instant if I will. END
BEGIN NOW --Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. END
BEGIN NOW You don't
know yet what money is. END
BEGIN NOW Money is power. END
BEGIN NOW When you have lived as long as I
have. END
BEGIN NOW I know, I know. END
BEGIN NOW If youth but knew. END
BEGIN NOW But what does Shakespeare say? END
BEGIN NOW PUT BUT MONEY IN THY PURSE. END
BEGIN NOW --Iago, Stephen murmured. END
BEGIN NOW He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare. END
BEGIN NOW --He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW He made money. END
BEGIN NOW A poet, yes,
but an Englishman too. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what is the pride of the English? END
BEGIN NOW Do
you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an
Englishman's mouth? END
BEGIN NOW The seas' ruler. END
BEGIN NOW His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating. END
BEGIN NOW --That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets. END
BEGIN NOW --Ba! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy cried. END
BEGIN NOW That's not English. END
BEGIN NOW A French Celt said that. END
BEGIN NOW He
tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail. END
BEGIN NOW --I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. END
BEGIN NOW I PAID
MY WAY. END
BEGIN NOW Good man, good man. END
BEGIN NOW --I PAID MY WAY. END
BEGIN NOW I NEVER BORROWED A SHILLING IN MY LIFE. END
BEGIN NOW Can you feel
that? END
BEGIN NOW I OWE NOTHING. END
BEGIN NOW Can you? END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties. END
BEGIN NOW Curran, ten guineas. END
BEGIN NOW McCann, one guinea. END
BEGIN NOW Fred Ryan, two shillings. END
BEGIN NOW Temple, two lunches. END
BEGIN NOW Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob
Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five
weeks' board. END
BEGIN NOW The lump I have is useless. END
BEGIN NOW --For the moment, no, Stephen answered. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox. END
BEGIN NOW --I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. END
BEGIN NOW But one day you must feel it. END
BEGIN NOW We
are a generous people but we must also be just. END
BEGIN NOW --I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at
the shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince of
Wales. END
BEGIN NOW --You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. END
BEGIN NOW I
saw three generations since O'Connell's time. END
BEGIN NOW I remember the famine
in '46. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the
union twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your
communion denounced him as a demagogue? END
BEGIN NOW You fenians forget some things. END
BEGIN NOW Glorious, pious and immortal memory. END
BEGIN NOW The lodge of Diamond in
Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes. END
BEGIN NOW Hoarse, masked and
armed, the planters' covenant. END
BEGIN NOW The black north and true blue bible. END
BEGIN NOW Croppies lie down. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen sketched a brief gesture. END
BEGIN NOW --I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW On the spindle side. END
BEGIN NOW But I
am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. END
BEGIN NOW We are all
Irish, all kings' sons. END
BEGIN NOW --Alas, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW --PER VIAS RECTAS, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. END
BEGIN NOW He voted for it
and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so. END
BEGIN NOW LAL THE RAL THE RA
    THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN. END
BEGIN NOW A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. END
BEGIN NOW Soft day, sir John! END
BEGIN NOW Soft day, your honour! END
BEGIN NOW ... Day! END
BEGIN NOW ... Day! END
BEGIN NOW ... Two topboots jog dangling
on to Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Lal the ral the ra. END
BEGIN NOW Lal the ral the raddy. END
BEGIN NOW --That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
with some of your literary friends. END
BEGIN NOW I have a letter here for the press. END
BEGIN NOW Sit down a moment. END
BEGIN NOW I have just to copy the end. END
BEGIN NOW He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and
read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter. END
BEGIN NOW --Sit down. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, THE DICTATES OF COMMON
SENSE. END
BEGIN NOW Just a moment. END
BEGIN NOW He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his
elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard
slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. END
BEGIN NOW Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their
meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings' Repulse, the duke of
Westminster's Shotover, the duke of Beaufort's Ceylon, PRIX DE PARIS,
1866. END
BEGIN NOW Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. END
BEGIN NOW He saw their speeds,
backing king's colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds. END
BEGIN NOW --Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. END
BEGIN NOW But prompt ventilation of this
allimportant question ...

Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among
the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and
reek of the canteen, over the motley slush. END
BEGIN NOW Fair Rebel! END
BEGIN NOW Fair Rebel! END
BEGIN NOW Even
money the favourite: ten to one the field. END
BEGIN NOW Dicers and thimbleriggers we
hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the
meatfaced woman, a butcher's dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange. END
BEGIN NOW Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle. END
BEGIN NOW Again: a goal. END
BEGIN NOW I am among them, among their battling bodies in a
medley, the joust of life. END
BEGIN NOW You mean that knockkneed mother's darling who
seems to be slightly crawsick? END
BEGIN NOW Jousts. END
BEGIN NOW Time shocked rebounds, shock by
shock. END
BEGIN NOW Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the
slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts. END
BEGIN NOW --Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising. END
BEGIN NOW He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen stood up. END
BEGIN NOW --I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW It's about the
foot and mouth disease. END
BEGIN NOW Just look through it. END
BEGIN NOW There can be no two opinions
on the matter. END
BEGIN NOW May I trespass on your valuable space. END
BEGIN NOW That doctrine of LAISSEZ FAIRE
which so often in our history. END
BEGIN NOW Our cattle trade. END
BEGIN NOW The way of all our old
industries. END
BEGIN NOW Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme. END
BEGIN NOW European conflagration. END
BEGIN NOW Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the
channel. END
BEGIN NOW The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
agriculture. END
BEGIN NOW Pardoned a classical allusion. END
BEGIN NOW Cassandra. END
BEGIN NOW By a woman who
was no better than she should be. END
BEGIN NOW To come to the point at issue. END
BEGIN NOW --I don't mince words, do I? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on. END
BEGIN NOW Foot and mouth disease. END
BEGIN NOW Known as Koch's preparation. END
BEGIN NOW Serum and
virus. END
BEGIN NOW Percentage of salted horses. END
BEGIN NOW Rinderpest. END
BEGIN NOW Emperor's horses at
Murzsteg, lower Austria. END
BEGIN NOW Veterinary surgeons. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Henry Blackwood Price. END
BEGIN NOW Courteous offer a fair trial. END
BEGIN NOW Dictates of common sense. END
BEGIN NOW Allimportant
question. END
BEGIN NOW In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. END
BEGIN NOW Thanking
you for the hospitality of your columns. END
BEGIN NOW --I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You will see at the
next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. END
BEGIN NOW And it can be
cured. END
BEGIN NOW It is cured. END
BEGIN NOW My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. END
BEGIN NOW They offer
to come over here. END
BEGIN NOW I am trying to work up influence with the department. END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm going to try publicity. END
BEGIN NOW I am surrounded by difficulties,
by ... intrigues by ... backstairs influence by ... END
BEGIN NOW He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke. END
BEGIN NOW --Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. END
BEGIN NOW England is in the hands of the
jews. END
BEGIN NOW In all the highest places: her finance, her press. END
BEGIN NOW And they are the
signs of a nation's decay. END
BEGIN NOW Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's
vital strength. END
BEGIN NOW I have seen it coming these years. END
BEGIN NOW As sure as we are
standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. END
BEGIN NOW Old England is dying. END
BEGIN NOW He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
broad sunbeam. END
BEGIN NOW He faced about and back again. END
BEGIN NOW --Dying, he said again, if not dead by now. END
BEGIN NOW THE HARLOT'S CRY FROM STREET TO STREET
    SHALL WEAVE OLD ENGLAND'S WINDINGSHEET. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in
which he halted. END
BEGIN NOW --A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
gentile, is he not? END
BEGIN NOW --They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. END
BEGIN NOW And you can see
the darkness in their eyes. END
BEGIN NOW And that is why they are wanderers on the
earth to this day. END
BEGIN NOW On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Gabble of geese. END
BEGIN NOW They swarmed loud,
uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk
hats. END
BEGIN NOW Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. END
BEGIN NOW Their full
slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew
the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. END
BEGIN NOW Vain patience
to heap and hoard. END
BEGIN NOW Time surely would scatter all. END
BEGIN NOW A hoard heaped by the
roadside: plundered and passing on. END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes knew their years of
wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh. END
BEGIN NOW --Who has not? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW --What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy asked. END
BEGIN NOW He came forward a pace and stood by the table. END
BEGIN NOW His underjaw fell
sideways open uncertainly. END
BEGIN NOW Is this old wisdom? END
BEGIN NOW He waits to hear from me. END
BEGIN NOW --History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake. END
BEGIN NOW From the playfield the boys raised a shout. END
BEGIN NOW A whirring whistle: goal. END
BEGIN NOW What if that nightmare gave you a back kick? END
BEGIN NOW --The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW All human
history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:

--That is God. END
BEGIN NOW Hooray! END
BEGIN NOW Ay! END
BEGIN NOW Whrrwhee! END
BEGIN NOW --What? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy asked. END
BEGIN NOW --A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose
tweaked between his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Looking up again he set them free. END
BEGIN NOW --I am happier than you are, he said. END
BEGIN NOW We have committed many errors and
many sins. END
BEGIN NOW A woman brought sin into the world. END
BEGIN NOW For a woman who was no
better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years
the Greeks made war on Troy. END
BEGIN NOW A faithless wife first brought the strangers
to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman, O'Rourke, prince of
Breffni. END
BEGIN NOW A woman too brought Parnell low. END
BEGIN NOW Many errors, many failures but
not the one sin. END
BEGIN NOW I am a struggler now at the end of my days. END
BEGIN NOW But I will
fight for the right till the end. END
BEGIN NOW FOR ULSTER WILL FIGHT
    AND ULSTER WILL BE RIGHT. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen raised the sheets in his hand. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, sir, he began ...

--I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at
this work. END
BEGIN NOW You were not born to be a teacher, I think. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps I am
wrong. END
BEGIN NOW --A learner rather, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW And here what will you learn more? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy shook his head. END
BEGIN NOW --Who knows? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW To learn one must be humble. END
BEGIN NOW But life is the great
teacher. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen rustled the sheets again. END
BEGIN NOW --As regards these, he began. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You have two copies there. END
BEGIN NOW If you can have them
published at once. END
BEGIN NOW TELEGRAPH. END
BEGIN NOW IRISH HOMESTEAD. END
BEGIN NOW --I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW I know two editors
slightly. END
BEGIN NOW --That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. END
BEGIN NOW I wrote last night to Mr Field,
M.P. END
BEGIN NOW There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the
City Arms hotel. END
BEGIN NOW I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. END
BEGIN NOW You see
if you can get it into your two papers. END
BEGIN NOW What are they? END
BEGIN NOW --THE EVENING TELEGRAPH ...

--That will do, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW There is no time to lose. END
BEGIN NOW Now I have to
answer that letter from my cousin. END
BEGIN NOW --Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW --Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. END
BEGIN NOW I like
to break a lance with you, old as I am. END
BEGIN NOW --Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back. END
BEGIN NOW He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the
trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. END
BEGIN NOW The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:
toothless terrors. END
BEGIN NOW Still I will help him in his fight. END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan will dub
me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard. END
BEGIN NOW --Mr Dedalus! END
BEGIN NOW Running after me. END
BEGIN NOW No more letters, I hope. END
BEGIN NOW --Just one moment. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath. END
BEGIN NOW --I just wanted to say, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland, they say, has the honour of
being the only country which never persecuted the jews. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know that? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW And do you know why? END
BEGIN NOW He frowned sternly on the bright air. END
BEGIN NOW --Why, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked, beginning to smile. END
BEGIN NOW --Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly. END
BEGIN NOW A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
rattling chain of phlegm. END
BEGIN NOW He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his
lifted arms waving to the air. END
BEGIN NOW --She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. END
BEGIN NOW That's why. END
BEGIN NOW On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
spangles, dancing coins. END
BEGIN NOW * * * * * * *


Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
through my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and
seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. END
BEGIN NOW Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:
coloured signs. END
BEGIN NOW Limits of the diaphane. END
BEGIN NOW But he adds: in bodies. END
BEGIN NOW Then he
was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. END
BEGIN NOW How? END
BEGIN NOW By knocking his
sconce against them, sure. END
BEGIN NOW Go easy. END
BEGIN NOW Bald he was and a millionaire, MAESTRO
DI COLOR CHE SANNO. END
BEGIN NOW Limit of the diaphane in. END
BEGIN NOW Why in? END
BEGIN NOW Diaphane,
adiaphane. END
BEGIN NOW If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if
not a door. END
BEGIN NOW Shut your eyes and see. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
shells. END
BEGIN NOW You are walking through it howsomever. END
BEGIN NOW I am, a stride at a time. END
BEGIN NOW A
very short space of time through very short times of space. END
BEGIN NOW Five, six: the
NACHEINANDER. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the
audible. END
BEGIN NOW Open your eyes. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus! END
BEGIN NOW If I fell over a cliff that beetles
o'er his base, fell through the NEBENEINANDER ineluctably! END
BEGIN NOW I am getting on
nicely in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW My ash sword hangs at my side. END
BEGIN NOW Tap with it: they do. END
BEGIN NOW My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, NEBENEINANDER. END
BEGIN NOW Sounds solid: made by the mallet of LOS DEMIURGOS. END
BEGIN NOW Am I walking into
eternity along Sandymount strand? END
BEGIN NOW Crush, crack, crick, crick. END
BEGIN NOW Wild sea
money. END
BEGIN NOW Dominie Deasy kens them a'. END
BEGIN NOW WON'T YOU COME TO SANDYMOUNT,
    MADELINE THE MARE? END
BEGIN NOW Rhythm begins, you see. END
BEGIN NOW I hear. END
BEGIN NOW Acatalectic tetrameter of iambs
marching. END
BEGIN NOW No, agallop: DELINE THE MARE. END
BEGIN NOW Open your eyes now. END
BEGIN NOW I will. END
BEGIN NOW One moment. END
BEGIN NOW Has all vanished since? END
BEGIN NOW If I
open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. END
BEGIN NOW BASTA! END
BEGIN NOW I will see if I can
see. END
BEGIN NOW See now. END
BEGIN NOW There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world
without end. END
BEGIN NOW They came down the steps from Leahy's terrace prudently,
FRAUENZIMMER: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet
sinking in the silted sand. END
BEGIN NOW Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty
mother. END
BEGIN NOW Number one swung lourdily her midwife's bag, the other's gamp
poked in the beach. END
BEGIN NOW From the liberties, out for the day. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Florence
MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride
Street. END
BEGIN NOW One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. END
BEGIN NOW Creation from
nothing. END
BEGIN NOW What has she in the bag? END
BEGIN NOW A misbirth with a trailing navelcord,
hushed in ruddy wool. END
BEGIN NOW The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of
all flesh. END
BEGIN NOW That is why mystic monks. END
BEGIN NOW Will you be as gods? END
BEGIN NOW Gaze in your
OMPHALOS. END
BEGIN NOW Hello! END
BEGIN NOW Kinch here. END
BEGIN NOW Put me on to Edenville. END
BEGIN NOW Aleph, alpha: nought,

soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. END

slunk back in a curve. END

lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock. END

against it. END

quick short at an unsmelt rock. END

hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. END

flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling. END

and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water
swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. END
BEGIN NOW Day by day: night by night:
lifted, flooded and let fall. END
BEGIN NOW Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,
they sigh. END

wonder, or does it mean something perhaps? END
BEGIN NOW My handkerchief. END
BEGIN NOW He threw it. END
BEGIN NOW I remember. END
BEGIN NOW Did I not take it up? END
BEGIN NOW His hand groped vainly in his pockets. END
BEGIN NOW No, I didn't. END
BEGIN NOW Better buy one. END
BEGIN NOW He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,
carefully. END
BEGIN NOW For the rest let look who will. END
BEGIN NOW Behind. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps there is someone. END
BEGIN NOW He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. END
BEGIN NOW Moving through
the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the
crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship. END
BEGIN NOW -- II --


Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. END
BEGIN NOW He
liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. END
BEGIN NOW Most of all he
liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
faintly scented urine. END
BEGIN NOW Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting
her breakfast things on the humpy tray. END
BEGIN NOW Gelid light and air were in the
kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW Made him feel
a bit peckish. END
BEGIN NOW The coals were reddening. END
BEGIN NOW Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. END
BEGIN NOW She didn't like
her plate full. END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the
hob and set it sideways on the fire. END
BEGIN NOW It sat there, dull and squat, its
spout stuck out. END
BEGIN NOW Cup of tea soon. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW Mouth dry. END
BEGIN NOW The cat walked stiffly
round a leg of the table with tail on high. END
BEGIN NOW --Mkgnao! END
BEGIN NOW --O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire. END
BEGIN NOW The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
table, mewing. END
BEGIN NOW Just how she stalks over my writingtable. END
BEGIN NOW Prr. END
BEGIN NOW Scratch my
head. END
BEGIN NOW Prr. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. END
BEGIN NOW Clean to see:
the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail,
the green flashing eyes. END
BEGIN NOW He bent down to her, his hands on his knees. END
BEGIN NOW --Milk for the pussens, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --Mrkgnao! END
BEGIN NOW the cat cried. END
BEGIN NOW They call them stupid. END
BEGIN NOW They understand what we say better than we
understand them. END
BEGIN NOW She understands all she wants to. END
BEGIN NOW Vindictive too. END
BEGIN NOW Cruel. END
BEGIN NOW Her nature. END
BEGIN NOW Curious mice never squeal. END
BEGIN NOW Seem to like it. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder what I
look like to her. END
BEGIN NOW Height of a tower? END
BEGIN NOW No, she can jump me. END
BEGIN NOW --Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. END
BEGIN NOW Afraid of the
chookchooks. END
BEGIN NOW I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens. END
BEGIN NOW Cruel. END
BEGIN NOW Her nature. END
BEGIN NOW Curious mice never squeal. END
BEGIN NOW Seem to like it. END
BEGIN NOW --Mrkrgnao! END
BEGIN NOW the cat said loudly. END
BEGIN NOW She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and
long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. END
BEGIN NOW He watched the dark eyeslits
narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. END
BEGIN NOW Then he went to the
dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him, poured
warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW --Gurrhr! END
BEGIN NOW she cried, running to lap. END
BEGIN NOW He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
three times and licked lightly. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is it true if you clip them they
can't mouse after. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. END
BEGIN NOW Or
kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW He listened to her licking lap. END
BEGIN NOW Ham and eggs, no. END
BEGIN NOW No good eggs with this
drouth. END
BEGIN NOW Want pure fresh water. END
BEGIN NOW Thursday: not a good day either for a
mutton kidney at Buckley's. END
BEGIN NOW Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Better
a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. END
BEGIN NOW While the kettle is boiling. END
BEGIN NOW She lapped
slower, then licking the saucer clean. END
BEGIN NOW Why are their tongues so rough? END
BEGIN NOW To
lap better, all porous holes. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing she can eat? END
BEGIN NOW He glanced round him. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
the bedroom door. END
BEGIN NOW She might like something tasty. END
BEGIN NOW Thin bread and butter
she likes in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Still perhaps: once in a way. END
BEGIN NOW He said softly in the bare hall:

--I'm going round the corner. END
BEGIN NOW Be back in a minute. END
BEGIN NOW And when he had heard his voice say it he added:

--You don't want anything for breakfast? END
BEGIN NOW A sleepy soft grunt answered:

--Mn. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW She didn't want anything. END
BEGIN NOW He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as
she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. END
BEGIN NOW Must
get those settled really. END
BEGIN NOW Pity. END
BEGIN NOW All the way from Gibraltar. END
BEGIN NOW Forgotten any
little Spanish she knew. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder what her father gave for it. END
BEGIN NOW Old style. END
BEGIN NOW Ah yes! END
BEGIN NOW of course. END
BEGIN NOW Bought it at the governor's auction. END
BEGIN NOW Got a short
knock. END
BEGIN NOW Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW At Plevna that
was. END
BEGIN NOW I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it. END
BEGIN NOW Still he had brains
enough to make that corner in stamps. END
BEGIN NOW Now that was farseeing. END
BEGIN NOW His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and
his lost property office secondhand waterproof. END
BEGIN NOW Stamps: stickyback
pictures. END
BEGIN NOW Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. END
BEGIN NOW Course they do. END
BEGIN NOW The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's high
grade ha. END
BEGIN NOW He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. END
BEGIN NOW White slip of
paper. END
BEGIN NOW Quite safe. END
BEGIN NOW On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. END
BEGIN NOW Not there. END
BEGIN NOW In
the trousers I left off. END
BEGIN NOW Must get it. END
BEGIN NOW Potato I have. END
BEGIN NOW Creaky wardrobe. END
BEGIN NOW No
use disturbing her. END
BEGIN NOW She turned over sleepily that time. END
BEGIN NOW He pulled the
halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped
gently over the threshold, a limp lid. END
BEGIN NOW Looked shut. END
BEGIN NOW All right till I come
back anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
seventyfive. END
BEGIN NOW The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. END
BEGIN NOW Be a
warm day I fancy. END
BEGIN NOW Specially in these black clothes feel it more. END
BEGIN NOW Black
conducts, reflects, (refracts is it? END
BEGIN NOW ), the heat. END
BEGIN NOW But I couldn't go in
that light suit. END
BEGIN NOW Make a picnic of it. END
BEGIN NOW His eyelids sank quietly often as
he walked in happy warmth. END
BEGIN NOW Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our
daily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. END
BEGIN NOW Makes you feel young. END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
dawn. END
BEGIN NOW Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him. END
BEGIN NOW Keep
it up for ever never grow a day older technically. END
BEGIN NOW Walk along a strand,
strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old
Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. END
BEGIN NOW Wander
through awned streets. END
BEGIN NOW Turbaned faces going by. END
BEGIN NOW Dark caves of carpet
shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled
pipe. END
BEGIN NOW Cries of sellers in the streets. END
BEGIN NOW Drink water scented with fennel,
sherbet. END
BEGIN NOW Dander along all day. END
BEGIN NOW Might meet a robber or two. END
BEGIN NOW Well, meet
him. END
BEGIN NOW Getting on to sundown. END
BEGIN NOW The shadows of the mosques among the pillars:
priest with a scroll rolled up. END
BEGIN NOW A shiver of the trees, signal, the
evening wind. END
BEGIN NOW I pass on. END
BEGIN NOW Fading gold sky. END
BEGIN NOW A mother watches me from her
doorway. END
BEGIN NOW She calls her children home in their dark language. END
BEGIN NOW High wall:
beyond strings twanged. END
BEGIN NOW Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly's new
garters. END
BEGIN NOW Strings. END
BEGIN NOW Listen. END
BEGIN NOW A girl playing one of those instruments what do
you call them: dulcimers. END
BEGIN NOW I pass. END
BEGIN NOW Probably not a bit like it really. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of stuff you read: in the track
of the sun. END
BEGIN NOW Sunburst on the titlepage. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled, pleasing himself. END
BEGIN NOW What
Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the FREEMAN leader: a
homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank
of Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW He prolonged his pleased smile. END
BEGIN NOW Ikey touch that: homerule sun
rising up in the north-west. END
BEGIN NOW He approached Larry O'Rourke's. END
BEGIN NOW From the cellar grating floated up the
flabby gush of porter. END
BEGIN NOW Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. END
BEGIN NOW Good house, however: just the end
of the city traffic. END
BEGIN NOW For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as
position. END
BEGIN NOW Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from
the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot. END
BEGIN NOW Baldhead over the blind. END
BEGIN NOW Cute old codger. END
BEGIN NOW No use canvassing him for an
ad. END
BEGIN NOW Still he knows his own business best. END
BEGIN NOW There he is, sure enough, my
bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the
aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. END
BEGIN NOW Simon Dedalus takes him off
to a tee with his eyes screwed up. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what I'm going to tell
you? END
BEGIN NOW What's that, Mr O'Rourke? END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what? END
BEGIN NOW The Russians, they'd
only be an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese. END
BEGIN NOW Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Sad thing about poor
Dignam, Mr O'Rourke. END
BEGIN NOW Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the
doorway:

--Good day, Mr O'Rourke. END
BEGIN NOW --Good day to you. END
BEGIN NOW --Lovely weather, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --'Tis all that. END
BEGIN NOW Where do they get the money? END
BEGIN NOW Coming up redheaded curates from the county
Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. END
BEGIN NOW Then, lo and behold,
they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. END
BEGIN NOW Then thin of the
competition. END
BEGIN NOW General thirst. END
BEGIN NOW Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without
passing a pub. END
BEGIN NOW Save it they can't. END
BEGIN NOW Off the drunks perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Put down three
and carry five. END
BEGIN NOW What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs. END
BEGIN NOW On
the wholesale orders perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Doing a double shuffle with the town
travellers. END
BEGIN NOW Square it you with the boss and we'll split the job, see? END
BEGIN NOW How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? END
BEGIN NOW Say ten barrels
of stuff. END
BEGIN NOW Say he got ten per cent off. END
BEGIN NOW O more. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen. END
BEGIN NOW He passed Saint
Joseph's National school. END
BEGIN NOW Brats' clamour. END
BEGIN NOW Windows open. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh air helps
memory. END
BEGIN NOW Or a lilt. END
BEGIN NOW Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee

BEGIN NOW Inishturk. END
BEGIN NOW Inishark. END

BEGIN NOW Mine. END
BEGIN NOW Slieve Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW He halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
polonies, black and white. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen multiplied by. END
BEGIN NOW The figures whitened in
his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. END
BEGIN NOW The shiny links, packed
with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm
breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood. END
BEGIN NOW A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. END
BEGIN NOW He stood
by the nextdoor girl at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW Would she buy it too, calling the
items from a slip in her hand? END
BEGIN NOW Chapped: washingsoda. END
BEGIN NOW And a pound and a
half of Denny's sausages. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. END
BEGIN NOW Woods his
name is. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder what he does. END
BEGIN NOW Wife is oldish. END
BEGIN NOW New blood. END
BEGIN NOW No followers
allowed. END
BEGIN NOW Strong pair of arms. END
BEGIN NOW Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. END
BEGIN NOW She
does whack it, by George. END
BEGIN NOW The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack. END
BEGIN NOW The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
blotchy fingers, sausagepink. END
BEGIN NOW Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer. END
BEGIN NOW He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at
Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. END
BEGIN NOW Can become ideal winter
sanatorium. END
BEGIN NOW Moses Montefiore. END
BEGIN NOW I thought he was. END
BEGIN NOW Farmhouse, wall round it,
blurred cattle cropping. END
BEGIN NOW He held the page from him: interesting: read it
nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. END
BEGIN NOW A
young white heifer. END
BEGIN NOW Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing
in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in
hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a
ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in their
hands. END
BEGIN NOW He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his
will, his soft subject gaze at rest. END
BEGIN NOW The crooked skirt swinging, whack by
whack by whack. END
BEGIN NOW The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
sausages and made a red grimace. END
BEGIN NOW --Now, my miss, he said. END
BEGIN NOW She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out. END
BEGIN NOW --Thank you, my miss. END
BEGIN NOW And one shilling threepence change. END
BEGIN NOW For you,
please? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom pointed quickly. END
BEGIN NOW To catch up and walk behind her if she went
slowly, behind her moving hams. END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant to see first thing in the
morning. END
BEGIN NOW Hurry up, damn it. END
BEGIN NOW Make hay while the sun shines. END
BEGIN NOW She stood
outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. END
BEGIN NOW He sighed
down his nose: they never understand. END
BEGIN NOW Sodachapped hands. END
BEGIN NOW Crusted toenails
too. END
BEGIN NOW Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. END
BEGIN NOW The sting of
disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. END
BEGIN NOW For another: a
constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. END
BEGIN NOW They like them sizeable. END
BEGIN NOW Prime sausage. END
BEGIN NOW O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the wood. END
BEGIN NOW --Threepence, please. END
BEGIN NOW His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket. END
BEGIN NOW Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them on
the rubber prickles. END
BEGIN NOW They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc
by disc, into the till. END
BEGIN NOW --Thank you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Another time. END
BEGIN NOW A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. END
BEGIN NOW He withdrew his gaze
after an instant. END
BEGIN NOW No: better not: another time. END
BEGIN NOW --Good morning, he said, moving away. END
BEGIN NOW --Good morning, sir. END
BEGIN NOW No sign. END
BEGIN NOW Gone. END
BEGIN NOW What matter? END
BEGIN NOW He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. END
BEGIN NOW Agendath Netaim:
planters' company. END
BEGIN NOW To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government
and plant with eucalyptus trees. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent for shade, fuel and
construction. END
BEGIN NOW Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. END
BEGIN NOW You
pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives,
oranges, almonds or citrons. END
BEGIN NOW Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial
irrigation. END
BEGIN NOW Every year you get a sending of the crop. END
BEGIN NOW Your name entered
for life as owner in the book of the union. END
BEGIN NOW Can pay ten down and the
balance in yearly instalments. END
BEGIN NOW Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing doing. END
BEGIN NOW Still an idea behind it. END
BEGIN NOW He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. END
BEGIN NOW Silverpowdered
olivetrees. END
BEGIN NOW Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. END
BEGIN NOW Olives are packed in
jars, eh? END
BEGIN NOW I have a few left from Andrews. END
BEGIN NOW Molly spitting them out. END
BEGIN NOW Knows
the taste of them now. END
BEGIN NOW Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. END
BEGIN NOW Citrons
too. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin's parade. END
BEGIN NOW And Mastiansky
with the old cither. END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant evenings we had then. END
BEGIN NOW Molly in Citron's
basketchair. END
BEGIN NOW Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to
the nostrils and smell the perfume. END
BEGIN NOW Like that, heavy, sweet, wild
perfume. END
BEGIN NOW Always the same, year after year. END
BEGIN NOW They fetched high prices too,
Moisel told me. END
BEGIN NOW Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. END
BEGIN NOW Must
be without a flaw, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,
Mediterranean, the Levant. END
BEGIN NOW Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap
ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled
dungarees. END
BEGIN NOW There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. END
BEGIN NOW How do you? END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't see. END
BEGIN NOW Chap
you know just to salute bit of a bore. END
BEGIN NOW His back is like that Norwegian
captain's. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if I'll meet him today. END
BEGIN NOW Watering cart. END
BEGIN NOW To provoke the
rain. END
BEGIN NOW On earth as it is in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. END
BEGIN NOW Grey. END
BEGIN NOW Far. END
BEGIN NOW No, not like that. END
BEGIN NOW A barren land, bare waste. END
BEGIN NOW Vulcanic lake, the dead
sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. END
BEGIN NOW No wind could lift those
waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. END
BEGIN NOW Brimstone they called it
raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. END
BEGIN NOW All dead
names. END
BEGIN NOW A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. END
BEGIN NOW Old now. END
BEGIN NOW It bore the
oldest, the first race. END
BEGIN NOW A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's, clutching a
naggin bottle by the neck. END
BEGIN NOW The oldest people. END
BEGIN NOW Wandered far away over all
the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born
everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW It lay there now. END
BEGIN NOW Now it could bear no more. END
BEGIN NOW Dead: an old
woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world. END
BEGIN NOW Desolation. END
BEGIN NOW Grey horror seared his flesh. END
BEGIN NOW Folding the page into his pocket he turned
into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. END
BEGIN NOW Cold oils slid along his veins,
chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I am here
now. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I am here now. END
BEGIN NOW Morning mouth bad images. END
BEGIN NOW Got up wrong side of
the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Must begin again those Sandow's exercises. END
BEGIN NOW On the hands down. END
BEGIN NOW Blotchy brown brick houses. END
BEGIN NOW Number eighty still unlet. END
BEGIN NOW Why is that? END
BEGIN NOW Valuation is only twenty-eight. END
BEGIN NOW Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur:
parlour windows plastered with bills. END
BEGIN NOW Plasters on a sore eye. END
BEGIN NOW To smell
the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. END
BEGIN NOW Be near her
ample bedwarmed flesh. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
sandals, along the brightening footpath. END
BEGIN NOW Runs, she runs to meet me, a
girl with gold hair on the wind. END
BEGIN NOW Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. END
BEGIN NOW He stooped and gathered
them. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Marion Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW His quickened heart slowed at once. END
BEGIN NOW Bold hand. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Marion. END
BEGIN NOW --Poldy! END
BEGIN NOW Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
yellow twilight towards her tousled head. END
BEGIN NOW --Who are the letters for? END
BEGIN NOW He looked at them. END
BEGIN NOW Mullingar. END
BEGIN NOW Milly. END
BEGIN NOW --A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. END
BEGIN NOW And a
letter for you. END
BEGIN NOW He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her
knees. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you want the blind up? END
BEGIN NOW Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow. END
BEGIN NOW --That do? END
BEGIN NOW he asked, turning. END
BEGIN NOW She was reading the card, propped on her elbow. END
BEGIN NOW --She got the things, she said. END
BEGIN NOW He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly
with a snug sigh. END
BEGIN NOW --Hurry up with that tea, she said. END
BEGIN NOW I'm parched. END
BEGIN NOW --The kettle is boiling, he said. END
BEGIN NOW But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed. END
BEGIN NOW As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:

--Poldy! END
BEGIN NOW --What? END
BEGIN NOW --Scald the teapot. END
BEGIN NOW On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. END
BEGIN NOW He scalded and
rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the
kettle then to let the water flow in. END
BEGIN NOW Having set it to draw he took off
the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump
of butter slide and melt. END
BEGIN NOW While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed
hungrily against him. END
BEGIN NOW Give her too much meat she won't mouse. END
BEGIN NOW Say they
won't eat pork. END
BEGIN NOW Kosher. END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her
and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Pepper. END
BEGIN NOW He
sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup. END
BEGIN NOW Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks:
new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan's
seaside girls. END
BEGIN NOW The tea was drawn. END
BEGIN NOW He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown

Derby, smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Silly Milly's birthday gift. END
BEGIN NOW Only five she was then. END
BEGIN NOW No,
wait: four. END
BEGIN NOW I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. END
BEGIN NOW Putting pieces of
folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled, pouring. END
BEGIN NOW O, MILLY BLOOM, YOU ARE MY DARLING. END
BEGIN NOW YOU ARE MY LOOKINGGLASS FROM NIGHT TO MORNING. END
BEGIN NOW I'D RATHER HAVE YOU WITHOUT A FARTHING
    THAN KATEY KEOGH WITH HER ASS AND GARDEN. END
BEGIN NOW Poor old professor Goodwin. END
BEGIN NOW Dreadful old case. END
BEGIN NOW Still he was a courteous
old chap. END
BEGIN NOW Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. END
BEGIN NOW And the
little mirror in his silk hat. END
BEGIN NOW The night Milly brought it into the
parlour. END
BEGIN NOW O, look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat! END
BEGIN NOW All we laughed. END
BEGIN NOW Sex breaking out even then. END
BEGIN NOW Pert little piece she was. END
BEGIN NOW He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
teapot on the tray. END
BEGIN NOW Its hump bumped as he took it up. END
BEGIN NOW Everything on it? END
BEGIN NOW Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW He carried it
upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle. END
BEGIN NOW Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on
the chair by the bedhead. END
BEGIN NOW --What a time you were! END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on
the pillow. END
BEGIN NOW He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft
bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder. END
BEGIN NOW The warmth of
her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea
she poured. END
BEGIN NOW A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. END
BEGIN NOW In the act
of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread. END
BEGIN NOW --Who was the letter from? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Bold hand. END
BEGIN NOW Marion. END
BEGIN NOW --O, Boylan, she said. END
BEGIN NOW He's bringing the programme. END
BEGIN NOW --What are you singing? END
BEGIN NOW --LA CI DAREM with J. C. Doyle, she said, and LOVE'S OLD SWEET SONG. END
BEGIN NOW Her full lips, drinking, smiled. END
BEGIN NOW Rather stale smell that incense leaves
next day. END
BEGIN NOW Like foul flowerwater. END
BEGIN NOW --Would you like the window open a little? END
BEGIN NOW She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:

--What time is the funeral? END
BEGIN NOW --Eleven, I think, he answered. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't see the paper. END
BEGIN NOW Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
drawers from the bed. END
BEGIN NOW No? END
BEGIN NOW Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
stocking: rumpled, shiny sole. END
BEGIN NOW --No: that book. END
BEGIN NOW Other stocking. END
BEGIN NOW Her petticoat. END
BEGIN NOW --It must have fell down, she said. END
BEGIN NOW He felt here and there. END
BEGIN NOW VOGLIO E NON VORREI. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if she pronounces
that right: VOGLIO. END
BEGIN NOW Not in the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Must have slid down. END
BEGIN NOW He stooped and
lifted the valance. END
BEGIN NOW The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the
orangekeyed chamberpot. END
BEGIN NOW --Show here, she said. END
BEGIN NOW I put a mark in it. END
BEGIN NOW There's a word I wanted to ask
you. END
BEGIN NOW She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having
wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text
with the hairpin till she reached the word. END
BEGIN NOW --Met him what? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Here, she said. END
BEGIN NOW What does that mean? END
BEGIN NOW He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail. END
BEGIN NOW --Metempsychosis? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Who's he when he's at home? END
BEGIN NOW --Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. END
BEGIN NOW It's Greek: from the Greek. END
BEGIN NOW That
means the transmigration of souls. END
BEGIN NOW --O, rocks! END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW Tell us in plain words. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. END
BEGIN NOW The same young eyes. END
BEGIN NOW The
first night after the charades. END
BEGIN NOW Dolphin's Barn. END
BEGIN NOW He turned over the
smudged pages. END
BEGIN NOW RUBY: THE PRIDE OF THE RING. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END
BEGIN NOW Illustration. END
BEGIN NOW Fierce
Italian with carriagewhip. END
BEGIN NOW Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked. END
BEGIN NOW Sheet kindly lent. END
BEGIN NOW THE MONSTER MAFFEI DESISTED AND FLUNG HIS VICTIM FROM
HIM WITH AN OATH. END
BEGIN NOW Cruelty behind it all. END
BEGIN NOW Doped animals. END
BEGIN NOW Trapeze at
Hengler's. END
BEGIN NOW Had to look the other way. END
BEGIN NOW Mob gaping. END
BEGIN NOW Break your neck and
we'll break our sides. END
BEGIN NOW Families of them. END
BEGIN NOW Bone them young so they
metamspychosis. END
BEGIN NOW That we live after death. END
BEGIN NOW Our souls. END
BEGIN NOW That a man's soul
after he dies. END
BEGIN NOW Dignam's soul ...

--Did you finish it? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, she said. END
BEGIN NOW There's nothing smutty in it. END
BEGIN NOW Is she in love with the
first fellow all the time? END
BEGIN NOW --Never read it. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want another? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Get another of Paul de Kock's. END
BEGIN NOW Nice name he has. END
BEGIN NOW She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways. END
BEGIN NOW Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they'll write to
Kearney, my guarantor. END
BEGIN NOW Reincarnation: that's the word. END
BEGIN NOW --Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body
after death, that we lived before. END
BEGIN NOW They call it reincarnation. END
BEGIN NOW That we
all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other
planet. END
BEGIN NOW They say we have forgotten it. END
BEGIN NOW Some say they remember their past
lives. END
BEGIN NOW The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. END
BEGIN NOW Bette remind
her of the word: metempsychosis. END
BEGIN NOW An example would be better. END
BEGIN NOW An example? END
BEGIN NOW The BATH OF THE NYMPH over the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Given away with the Easter number of
PHOTO BITS: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. END
BEGIN NOW Tea before you put milk
in. END
BEGIN NOW Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. END
BEGIN NOW Three and six I gave for
the frame. END
BEGIN NOW She said it would look nice over the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Naked nymphs:
Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then. END
BEGIN NOW He turned the pages back. END
BEGIN NOW --Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. END
BEGIN NOW They
used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
instance. END
BEGIN NOW What they called nymphs, for example. END
BEGIN NOW Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. END
BEGIN NOW She gazed straight before her,
inhaling through her arched nostrils. END
BEGIN NOW --There's a smell of burn, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Did you leave anything on the fire? END
BEGIN NOW --The kidney! END
BEGIN NOW he cried suddenly. END
BEGIN NOW He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs. END
BEGIN NOW Pungent smoke shot
up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. END
BEGIN NOW By prodding a prong of the
fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. END
BEGIN NOW Only a little burnt. END
BEGIN NOW He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the
scanty brown gravy trickle over it. END
BEGIN NOW Cup of tea now. END
BEGIN NOW He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. END
BEGIN NOW He
shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. END
BEGIN NOW Then he put a forkful
into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. END
BEGIN NOW Done
to a turn. END
BEGIN NOW A mouthful of tea. END
BEGIN NOW Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one
in the gravy and put it in his mouth. END
BEGIN NOW What was that about some young
student and a picnic? END
BEGIN NOW He creased out the letter at his side, reading it
slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and
raising it to his mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Dearest Papli

BEGIN NOW It suits me

BEGIN NOW Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. END

BEGIN NOW There is a
young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or

writing Blazes Boylan's) song about those seaside girls. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him silly

BEGIN NOW I must now close with fondest love


Your fond daughter,     MILLY. END
BEGIN NOW P. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. END
BEGIN NOW Byby. END
BEGIN NOW M.


Fifteen yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW Curious, fifteenth of the month too. END
BEGIN NOW Her first
birthday away from home. END
BEGIN NOW Separation. END
BEGIN NOW Remember the summer morning she was
born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. END
BEGIN NOW Jolly old
woman. END
BEGIN NOW Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. END
BEGIN NOW She knew from
the first poor little Rudy wouldn't live. END
BEGIN NOW Well, God is good, sir. END
BEGIN NOW She
knew at once. END
BEGIN NOW He would be eleven now if he had lived. END
BEGIN NOW His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse bad writing. END
BEGIN NOW Hurry. END
BEGIN NOW Piano downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW Coming out of her shell. END
BEGIN NOW Row with her in the XL
Cafe about the bracelet. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't eat her cakes or speak or look. END
BEGIN NOW Saucebox. END
BEGIN NOW He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after
piece of kidney. END
BEGIN NOW Twelve and six a week. END
BEGIN NOW Not much. END
BEGIN NOW Still, she might do
worse. END
BEGIN NOW Music hall stage. END
BEGIN NOW Young student. END
BEGIN NOW He drank a draught of cooler tea
to wash down his meal. END
BEGIN NOW Then he read the letter again: twice. END
BEGIN NOW O, well: she knows how to mind herself. END
BEGIN NOW But if not? END
BEGIN NOW No, nothing has
happened. END
BEGIN NOW Of course it might. END
BEGIN NOW Wait in any case till it does. END
BEGIN NOW A wild piece
of goods. END
BEGIN NOW Her slim legs running up the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW Destiny. END
BEGIN NOW Ripening now. END
BEGIN NOW Vain: very. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. END
BEGIN NOW Day I caught her
in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. END
BEGIN NOW Anemic a little. END
BEGIN NOW Was
given milk too long. END
BEGIN NOW On the ERIN'S KING that day round the Kish. END
BEGIN NOW Damned
old tub pitching about. END
BEGIN NOW Not a bit funky. END
BEGIN NOW Her pale blue scarf loose in the
wind with her hair. END
BEGIN NOW ALL DIMPLED CHEEKS AND CURLS,
    YOUR HEAD IT SIMPLY SWIRLS. END
BEGIN NOW Seaside girls. END
BEGIN NOW Torn envelope. END
BEGIN NOW Hands stuck in his trousers' pockets,
jarvey off for the day, singing. END
BEGIN NOW Friend of the family. END
BEGIN NOW Swurls, he says. END
BEGIN NOW Pier with lamps, summer evening, band,


    THOSE GIRLS, THOSE GIRLS,
    THOSE LOVELY SEASIDE GIRLS. END
BEGIN NOW Milly too. END
BEGIN NOW Young kisses: the first. END
BEGIN NOW Far away now past. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Marion. END
BEGIN NOW Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,
braiding. END
BEGIN NOW A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. END
BEGIN NOW Will happen,
yes. END
BEGIN NOW Prevent. END
BEGIN NOW Useless: can't move. END
BEGIN NOW Girl's sweet light lips. END
BEGIN NOW Will happen
too. END
BEGIN NOW He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. END
BEGIN NOW Useless to move now. END
BEGIN NOW Lips
kissed, kissing, kissed. END
BEGIN NOW Full gluey woman's lips. END
BEGIN NOW Better where she is down there: away. END
BEGIN NOW Occupy her. END
BEGIN NOW Wanted a dog to pass
the time. END
BEGIN NOW Might take a trip down there. END
BEGIN NOW August bank holiday, only two and
six return. END
BEGIN NOW Six weeks off, however. END
BEGIN NOW Might work a press pass. END
BEGIN NOW Or through
M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
nosed at it and stalked to the door. END
BEGIN NOW She looked back at him, mewing. END
BEGIN NOW Wants to go out. END
BEGIN NOW Wait before a door sometime it will open. END
BEGIN NOW Let her wait. END
BEGIN NOW Has the fidgets. END
BEGIN NOW Electric. END
BEGIN NOW Thunder in the air. END
BEGIN NOW Was washing at her ear
with her back to the fire too. END
BEGIN NOW He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. END
BEGIN NOW He stood up,
undoing the waistband of his trousers. END
BEGIN NOW The cat mewed to him. END
BEGIN NOW --Miaow! END
BEGIN NOW he said in answer. END
BEGIN NOW Wait till I'm ready. END
BEGIN NOW Heaviness: hot day coming. END
BEGIN NOW Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the
landing. END
BEGIN NOW A paper. END
BEGIN NOW He liked to read at stool. END
BEGIN NOW Hope no ape comes knocking just as
I'm. END
BEGIN NOW In the tabledrawer he found an old number of TITBITS. END
BEGIN NOW He folded it under
his armpit, went to the door and opened it. END
BEGIN NOW The cat went up in soft
bounds. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Listening, he heard her voice:

--Come, come, pussy. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards
the next garden. END
BEGIN NOW No sound. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. END
BEGIN NOW The maid
was in the garden. END
BEGIN NOW Fine morning. END
BEGIN NOW He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. END
BEGIN NOW Make
a summerhouse here. END
BEGIN NOW Scarlet runners. END
BEGIN NOW Virginia creepers. END
BEGIN NOW Want to manure
the whole place over, scabby soil. END
BEGIN NOW A coat of liver of sulphur. END
BEGIN NOW All soil
like that without dung. END
BEGIN NOW Household slops. END
BEGIN NOW Loam, what is this that is? END
BEGIN NOW The
hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing. END
BEGIN NOW Best
of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those
oilcakes. END
BEGIN NOW Mulch of dung. END
BEGIN NOW Best thing to clean ladies' kid gloves. END
BEGIN NOW Dirty
cleans. END
BEGIN NOW Ashes too. END
BEGIN NOW Reclaim the whole place. END
BEGIN NOW Grow peas in that corner
there. END
BEGIN NOW Lettuce. END
BEGIN NOW Always have fresh greens then. END
BEGIN NOW Still gardens have their
drawbacks. END
BEGIN NOW That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday. END
BEGIN NOW He walked on. END
BEGIN NOW Where is my hat, by the way? END
BEGIN NOW Must have put it back on the
peg. END
BEGIN NOW Or hanging up on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW Funny I don't remember that. END
BEGIN NOW Hallstand
too full. END
BEGIN NOW Four umbrellas, her raincloak. END
BEGIN NOW Picking up the letters. END
BEGIN NOW Drago's
shopbell ringing. END
BEGIN NOW Queer I was just thinking that moment. END
BEGIN NOW Brown
brillantined hair over his collar. END
BEGIN NOW Just had a wash and brushup. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder
have I time for a bath this morning. END
BEGIN NOW Tara street. END
BEGIN NOW Chap in the paybox
there got away James Stephens, they say. END
BEGIN NOW O'Brien. END
BEGIN NOW Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. END
BEGIN NOW Agendath what is it? END
BEGIN NOW Now, my miss. END
BEGIN NOW Enthusiast. END
BEGIN NOW He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. END
BEGIN NOW Better be careful not to get
these trousers dirty for the funeral. END
BEGIN NOW He went in, bowing his head under
the low lintel. END
BEGIN NOW Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash
and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. END
BEGIN NOW Before sitting down he peered
through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. END
BEGIN NOW The king was in his
countinghouse. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody. END
BEGIN NOW Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over
on his bared knees. END
BEGIN NOW Something new and easy. END
BEGIN NOW No great hurry. END
BEGIN NOW Keep it a
bit. END
BEGIN NOW Our prize titbit: MATCHAM'S MASTERSTROKE. END
BEGIN NOW Written by Mr Philip
Beaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. END
BEGIN NOW Payment at the rate of one guinea a
column has been made to the writer. END
BEGIN NOW Three and a half. END
BEGIN NOW Three pounds three. END
BEGIN NOW Three pounds, thirteen and six. END
BEGIN NOW Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but
resisting, began the second. END
BEGIN NOW Midway, his last resistance yielding, he
allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still
patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. END
BEGIN NOW Hope it's not
too big bring on piles again. END
BEGIN NOW No, just right. END
BEGIN NOW So. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Costive. END
BEGIN NOW One
tabloid of cascara sagrada. END
BEGIN NOW Life might be so. END
BEGIN NOW It did not move or touch
him but it was something quick and neat. END
BEGIN NOW Print anything now. END
BEGIN NOW Silly
season. END
BEGIN NOW He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. END
BEGIN NOW Neat
certainly. END
BEGIN NOW MATCHAM OFTEN THINKS OF THE MASTERSTROKE BY WHICH HE WON THE
LAUGHING WITCH WHO NOW. END
BEGIN NOW Begins and ends morally. END
BEGIN NOW HAND IN HAND. END
BEGIN NOW Smart. END
BEGIN NOW He
glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow
quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received
payment of three pounds, thirteen and six. END
BEGIN NOW Might manage a sketch. END
BEGIN NOW By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Invent a story for some
proverb. END
BEGIN NOW Which? END
BEGIN NOW Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said
dressing. END
BEGIN NOW Dislike dressing together. END
BEGIN NOW Nicked myself shaving. END
BEGIN NOW Biting her
nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. END
BEGIN NOW Timing her. END
BEGIN NOW 9.l5. END
BEGIN NOW Did
Roberts pay you yet? END
BEGIN NOW 9.20. END
BEGIN NOW What had Gretta Conroy on? END
BEGIN NOW 9.23. END
BEGIN NOW What
possessed me to buy this comb? END
BEGIN NOW 9.24. END
BEGIN NOW I'm swelled after that cabbage. END
BEGIN NOW A
speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot. END
BEGIN NOW Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. END
BEGIN NOW Morning
after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the
hours. END
BEGIN NOW Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
night hours. END
BEGIN NOW Washing her teeth. END
BEGIN NOW That was the first night. END
BEGIN NOW Her head
dancing. END
BEGIN NOW Her fansticks clicking. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Boylan well off? END
BEGIN NOW He has money. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. END
BEGIN NOW No use
humming then. END
BEGIN NOW Allude to it. END
BEGIN NOW Strange kind of music that last night. END
BEGIN NOW The
mirror was in shadow. END
BEGIN NOW She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
vest against her full wagging bub. END
BEGIN NOW Peering into it. END
BEGIN NOW Lines in her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW It
wouldn't pan out somehow. END
BEGIN NOW Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. END
BEGIN NOW Night hours then: black with daggers
and eyemasks. END
BEGIN NOW Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black. END
BEGIN NOW Still, true to life also. END
BEGIN NOW Day: then the night. END
BEGIN NOW He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. END
BEGIN NOW Then
he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. END
BEGIN NOW He pulled back
the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the
air. END
BEGIN NOW In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his
black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. END
BEGIN NOW What time
is the funeral? END
BEGIN NOW Better find out in the paper. END
BEGIN NOW A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. END
BEGIN NOW The bells of George's
church. END
BEGIN NOW They tolled the hour: loud dark iron. END
BEGIN NOW HEIGHO! END
BEGIN NOW HEIGHO! END
BEGIN NOW HEIGHO! END
BEGIN NOW HEIGHO! END
BEGIN NOW HEIGHO! END
BEGIN NOW HEIGHO! END
BEGIN NOW Quarter to. END
BEGIN NOW There again: the overtone following through the air, a third. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Dignam! END
BEGIN NOW * * * * * * *


By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
Windmill lane, Leask's the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office. END
BEGIN NOW Could have given that address too. END
BEGIN NOW And past the sailors' home. END
BEGIN NOW He turned
from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street. END
BEGIN NOW By Brady's cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal
linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. END
BEGIN NOW A smaller girl with scars of eczema on
her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him
if he smokes he won't grow. END
BEGIN NOW O let him! END
BEGIN NOW His life isn't such a bed of
roses. END
BEGIN NOW Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. END
BEGIN NOW Come home to ma, da. END
BEGIN NOW Slack
hour: won't be many there. END
BEGIN NOW He crossed Townsend street, passed the
frowning face of Bethel. END
BEGIN NOW El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. END
BEGIN NOW And past
Nichols' the undertaker. END
BEGIN NOW At eleven it is. END
BEGIN NOW Time enough. END
BEGIN NOW Daresay Corny
Kelleher bagged the job for O'Neill's. END
BEGIN NOW Singing with his eyes shut. END
BEGIN NOW Corny. END
BEGIN NOW Met her once in the park. END
BEGIN NOW In the dark. END
BEGIN NOW What a lark. END
BEGIN NOW Police tout. END
BEGIN NOW Her name
and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay. END
BEGIN NOW O, surely he
bagged it. END
BEGIN NOW Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. END
BEGIN NOW With my tooraloom,
tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom. END
BEGIN NOW In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
finest quality, family tea. END
BEGIN NOW Rather warm. END
BEGIN NOW Tea. END
BEGIN NOW Must get some from Tom
Kernan. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though. END
BEGIN NOW While his eyes still read
blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his
right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. END
BEGIN NOW Very warm morning. END
BEGIN NOW Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather
headband inside his high grade ha. END
BEGIN NOW Just there. END
BEGIN NOW His right hand came down
into the bowl of his hat. END
BEGIN NOW His fingers found quickly a card behind the
headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket. END
BEGIN NOW So warm. END
BEGIN NOW His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and
hair. END
BEGIN NOW Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice
blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. END
BEGIN NOW The far east. END
BEGIN NOW Lovely spot it
must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is it like
that. END
BEGIN NOW Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in DOLCE FAR NIENTE, not
doing a hand's turn all day. END
BEGIN NOW Sleep six months out of twelve. END
BEGIN NOW Too hot to
quarrel. END
BEGIN NOW Influence of the climate. END
BEGIN NOW Lethargy. END
BEGIN NOW Flowers of idleness. END
BEGIN NOW The air
feeds most. END
BEGIN NOW Azotes. END
BEGIN NOW Hothouse in Botanic gardens. END
BEGIN NOW Sensitive plants. END
BEGIN NOW Waterlilies. END
BEGIN NOW Petals too tired to. END
BEGIN NOW Sleeping sickness in the air. END
BEGIN NOW Walk on
roseleaves. END
BEGIN NOW Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. END
BEGIN NOW Where was the chap I
saw in that picture somewhere? END
BEGIN NOW Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his
back, reading a book with a parasol open. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't sink if you tried: so
thick with salt. END
BEGIN NOW Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the
body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? END
BEGIN NOW Or is it the volume
is equal to the weight? END
BEGIN NOW It's a law something like that. END
BEGIN NOW Vance in High
school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. END
BEGIN NOW The college curriculum. END
BEGIN NOW Cracking curriculum. END
BEGIN NOW What is weight really when you say the weight? END
BEGIN NOW Thirtytwo feet per second per second. END
BEGIN NOW Law of falling bodies: per second
per second. END
BEGIN NOW They all fall to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW The earth. END
BEGIN NOW It's the force of
gravity of the earth is the weight. END
BEGIN NOW He turned away and sauntered across the road. END
BEGIN NOW How did she walk with her
sausages? END
BEGIN NOW Like that something. END
BEGIN NOW As he walked he took the folded FREEMAN
from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and
tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. END
BEGIN NOW Careless air:
just drop in to see. END
BEGIN NOW Per second per second. END
BEGIN NOW Per second for every second
it means. END
BEGIN NOW From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of
the postoffice. END
BEGIN NOW Too late box. END
BEGIN NOW Post here. END
BEGIN NOW No-one. END
BEGIN NOW In. END
BEGIN NOW He handed the card through the brass grill. END
BEGIN NOW --Are there any letters for me? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton
against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. END
BEGIN NOW No answer
probably. END
BEGIN NOW Went too far last time. END
BEGIN NOW The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a
letter. END
BEGIN NOW He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope. END
BEGIN NOW Henry Flower Esq,
c/o P. O. Westland Row,
City. END
BEGIN NOW Answered anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,
reviewing again the soldiers on parade. END
BEGIN NOW Where's old Tweedy's regiment? END
BEGIN NOW Castoff soldier. END
BEGIN NOW There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. END
BEGIN NOW No, he's a
grenadier. END
BEGIN NOW Pointed cuffs. END
BEGIN NOW There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. END
BEGIN NOW Redcoats. END
BEGIN NOW Too showy. END
BEGIN NOW That must be why the women go after them. END
BEGIN NOW Uniform. END
BEGIN NOW Easier to
enlist and drill. END
BEGIN NOW Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell
street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. END
BEGIN NOW Griffith's paper is on
the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or
halfseasover empire. END
BEGIN NOW Half baked they look: hypnotised like. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes front. END
BEGIN NOW Mark time. END
BEGIN NOW Table: able. END
BEGIN NOW Bed: ed. END
BEGIN NOW The King's own. END
BEGIN NOW Never see him dressed up
as a fireman or a bobby. END
BEGIN NOW A mason, yes. END
BEGIN NOW He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. END
BEGIN NOW Talk: as if
that would mend matters. END
BEGIN NOW His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. END
BEGIN NOW Women will pay a lot of heed, I don't think. END
BEGIN NOW His fingers drew forth the
letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Something
pinned on: photo perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Hair? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW Get rid of him quickly. END
BEGIN NOW Take me out of my way. END
BEGIN NOW Hate company when
you. END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you off to? END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW Nowhere in particular. END
BEGIN NOW --How's the body? END
BEGIN NOW --Fine. END
BEGIN NOW How are you? END
BEGIN NOW --Just keeping alive, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:

--Is there any ... no trouble I hope? END
BEGIN NOW I see you're ...

--O, no, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Dignam, you know. END
BEGIN NOW The funeral is today. END
BEGIN NOW --To be sure, poor fellow. END
BEGIN NOW So it is. END
BEGIN NOW What time? END
BEGIN NOW A photo it isn't. END
BEGIN NOW A badge maybe. END
BEGIN NOW --E ... eleven, Mr Bloom answered. END
BEGIN NOW --I must try to get out there, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW Eleven, is it? END
BEGIN NOW I only heard it
last night. END
BEGIN NOW Who was telling me? END
BEGIN NOW Holohan. END
BEGIN NOW You know Hoppy? END
BEGIN NOW --I know. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
of the Grosvenor. END
BEGIN NOW The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. END
BEGIN NOW She stood
still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his
pockets for change. END
BEGIN NOW Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for
a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. END
BEGIN NOW Careless stand of her with her
hands in those patch pockets. END
BEGIN NOW Like that haughty creature at the polo
match. END
BEGIN NOW Women all for caste till you touch the spot. END
BEGIN NOW Handsome is and
handsome does. END
BEGIN NOW Reserved about to yield. END
BEGIN NOW The honourable Mrs and Brutus is
an honourable man. END
BEGIN NOW Possess her once take the starch out of her. END
BEGIN NOW --I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what do
you call him Bantam Lyons. END
BEGIN NOW Just down there in Conway's we were. END
BEGIN NOW Doran Lyons in Conway's. END
BEGIN NOW She raised a gloved hand to her hair. END
BEGIN NOW In came
Hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW Having a wet. END
BEGIN NOW Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
braided drums. END
BEGIN NOW Clearly I can see today. END
BEGIN NOW Moisture about gives long sight
perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Talking of one thing or another. END
BEGIN NOW Lady's hand. END
BEGIN NOW Which side will
she get up? END
BEGIN NOW --And he said: SAD THING ABOUT OUR POOR FRIEND PADDY! END
BEGIN NOW WHAT PADDY? END
BEGIN NOW I said. END
BEGIN NOW POOR LITTLE PADDY DIGNAM, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Off to the country: Broadstone probably. END
BEGIN NOW High brown boots with laces
dangling. END
BEGIN NOW Wellturned foot. END
BEGIN NOW What is he foostering over that change for? END
BEGIN NOW Sees me looking. END
BEGIN NOW Eye out for other fellow always. END
BEGIN NOW Good fallback. END
BEGIN NOW Two
strings to her bow. END
BEGIN NOW --WHY? END
BEGIN NOW I said. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? END
BEGIN NOW I said. END
BEGIN NOW Proud: rich: silk stockings. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. END
BEGIN NOW Getting up in a
minute. END
BEGIN NOW --WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? END
BEGIN NOW He said. END
BEGIN NOW HE'S DEAD, he said. END
BEGIN NOW And, faith, he
filled up. END
BEGIN NOW IS IT PADDY DIGNAM? END
BEGIN NOW I said. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't believe it when I heard
it. END
BEGIN NOW I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the
Arch. END
BEGIN NOW YES, he said. END
BEGIN NOW HE'S GONE. END
BEGIN NOW HE DIED ON MONDAY, POOR FELLOW. END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW Silk flash rich stockings white. END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between. END
BEGIN NOW Lost it. END
BEGIN NOW Curse your noisy pugnose. END
BEGIN NOW Feels locked out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Paradise and
the peri. END
BEGIN NOW Always happening like that. END
BEGIN NOW The very moment. END
BEGIN NOW Girl in Eustace
street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. END
BEGIN NOW Her friend covering the
display of. END
BEGIN NOW ESPRIT DE CORPS. END
BEGIN NOW Well, what are you gaping at? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. END
BEGIN NOW Another gone. END
BEGIN NOW --One of the best, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW The tram passed. END
BEGIN NOW They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
gloved hand on the steel grip. END
BEGIN NOW Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat
in the sun: flicker, flick. END
BEGIN NOW --Wife well, I suppose? END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy's changed voice said. END
BEGIN NOW --O, yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Tiptop, thanks. END
BEGIN NOW He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:


    WHAT IS HOME WITHOUT
    PLUMTREE'S POTTED MEAT? END
BEGIN NOW INCOMPLETE
    WITH IT AN ABODE OF BLISS. END
BEGIN NOW --My missus has just got an engagement. END
BEGIN NOW At least it's not settled yet. END
BEGIN NOW Valise tack again. END
BEGIN NOW By the way no harm. END
BEGIN NOW I'm off that, thanks. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness. END
BEGIN NOW --My wife too, he said. END
BEGIN NOW She's going to sing at a swagger affair in the
Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twenty-fifth. END
BEGIN NOW --That so? END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW Glad to hear that, old man. END
BEGIN NOW Who's getting it up? END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Marion Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Not up yet. END
BEGIN NOW Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and. END
BEGIN NOW No book. END

and fair man. END

BEGIN NOW Torn strip of envelope. END
BEGIN NOW LOVE'S
    OLD
    SWEET
    SONG
    COMES LO-OVE'S OLD ...


--It's a kind of a tour, don't you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully. END
BEGIN NOW SWEEEET SONG. END
BEGIN NOW There's a committee formed. END
BEGIN NOW Part shares and part profits. END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble. END
BEGIN NOW --O, well, he said. END
BEGIN NOW That's good news. END
BEGIN NOW He moved to go. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Meet you knocking around. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW --Tell you what, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW You might put down my name at the funeral,
will you? END
BEGIN NOW I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. END
BEGIN NOW There's a
drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
would have to go down if the body is found. END
BEGIN NOW You just shove in my name if
I'm not there, will you? END
BEGIN NOW --I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. END
BEGIN NOW That'll be all right. END
BEGIN NOW --Right, M'Coy said brightly. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, old man. END
BEGIN NOW I'd go if I possibly
could. END
BEGIN NOW Well, tolloll. END
BEGIN NOW Just C. P. M'Coy will do. END
BEGIN NOW --That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. END
BEGIN NOW The quick touch. END
BEGIN NOW Soft mark. END
BEGIN NOW I'd like
my job. END
BEGIN NOW Valise I have a particular fancy for. END
BEGIN NOW Leather. END
BEGIN NOW Capped corners,
rivetted edges, double action lever lock. END
BEGIN NOW Bob Cowley lent him his for the
Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that
good day to this. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. END
BEGIN NOW My missus has just
got an. END
BEGIN NOW Reedy freckled soprano. END
BEGIN NOW Cheeseparing nose. END
BEGIN NOW Nice enough in its
way: for a little ballad. END
BEGIN NOW No guts in it. END
BEGIN NOW You and me, don't you know: in
the same boat. END
BEGIN NOW Softsoaping. END
BEGIN NOW Give you the needle that would. END
BEGIN NOW Can't he hear
the difference? END
BEGIN NOW Think he's that way inclined a bit. END
BEGIN NOW Against my grain
somehow. END
BEGIN NOW Thought that Belfast would fetch him. END
BEGIN NOW I hope that smallpox up
there doesn't get worse. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose she wouldn't let herself be vaccinated
again. END
BEGIN NOW Your wife and my wife. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is he pimping after me? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
hoardings. END
BEGIN NOW Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic). END
BEGIN NOW Clery's Summer
Sale. END
BEGIN NOW No, he's going on straight. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END
BEGIN NOW LEAH tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Bandmann
Palmer. END
BEGIN NOW Like to see her again in that. END
BEGIN NOW HAMLET she played last night. END
BEGIN NOW Male
impersonator. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps he was a woman. END
BEGIN NOW Why Ophelia committed suicide. END
BEGIN NOW Poor
papa! END
BEGIN NOW How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. END
BEGIN NOW Outside the Adelphi in
London waited all the afternoon to get in. END
BEGIN NOW Year before I was born that
was: sixtyfive. END
BEGIN NOW And Ristori in Vienna. END
BEGIN NOW What is this the right name is? END
BEGIN NOW By
Mosenthal it is. END
BEGIN NOW Rachel, is it? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW The scene he was always talking about
where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on
his face. END
BEGIN NOW Nathan's voice! END
BEGIN NOW His son's voice! END
BEGIN NOW I hear the voice of Nathan who left his
father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his
father and left the God of his father. END
BEGIN NOW Every word is so deep, Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW Poor papa! END
BEGIN NOW Poor man! END
BEGIN NOW I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his
face. END
BEGIN NOW That day! END
BEGIN NOW O, dear! END
BEGIN NOW O, dear! END
BEGIN NOW Ffoo! END
BEGIN NOW Well, perhaps it was best for
him. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
hazard. END
BEGIN NOW No use thinking of it any more. END
BEGIN NOW Nosebag time. END
BEGIN NOW Wish I hadn't met
that M'Coy fellow. END
BEGIN NOW He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing
teeth. END
BEGIN NOW Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet
oaten reek of horsepiss. END
BEGIN NOW Their Eldorado. END
BEGIN NOW Poor jugginses! END
BEGIN NOW Damn all they
know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags. END
BEGIN NOW Too
full for words. END
BEGIN NOW Still they get their feed all right and their doss. END
BEGIN NOW Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their
haunches. END
BEGIN NOW Might be happy all the same that way. END
BEGIN NOW Good poor brutes they
look. END
BEGIN NOW Still their neigh can be very irritating. END
BEGIN NOW He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
carried. END
BEGIN NOW Might just walk into her here. END
BEGIN NOW The lane is safer. END
BEGIN NOW He passed the cabman's shelter. END
BEGIN NOW Curious the life of drifting cabbies. END
BEGIN NOW All
weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. END
BEGIN NOW VOGLIO E
NON. END
BEGIN NOW Like to give them an odd cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW Sociable. END
BEGIN NOW Shout a few flying
syllables as they pass. END
BEGIN NOW He hummed:


    LA CI DAREM LA MANO
    LA LA LALA LA LA. END
BEGIN NOW He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted
in the lee of the station wall. END
BEGIN NOW No-one. END
BEGIN NOW Meade's timberyard. END
BEGIN NOW Piled balks. END
BEGIN NOW Ruins and tenements. END
BEGIN NOW With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court
with its forgotten pickeystone. END
BEGIN NOW Not a sinner. END
BEGIN NOW Near the timberyard a
squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. END
BEGIN NOW A
wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. END
BEGIN NOW Pity to disturb
them. END
BEGIN NOW Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. END
BEGIN NOW Open it. END
BEGIN NOW And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame's school. END
BEGIN NOW She liked
mignonette. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Ellis's. END
BEGIN NOW And Mr? END
BEGIN NOW He opened the letter within the
newspaper. END
BEGIN NOW A flower. END
BEGIN NOW I think it's a. END
BEGIN NOW A yellow flower with flattened petals. END
BEGIN NOW Not
annoyed then? END
BEGIN NOW What does she say? END
BEGIN NOW Dear Henry

I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry
you did not like my last letter. END
BEGIN NOW Why did you enclose the stamps? END
BEGIN NOW I am
awfully angry with you. END
BEGIN NOW I do wish I could punish you for that. END
BEGIN NOW I called
you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. END
BEGIN NOW Please tell me
what is the real meaning of that word? END
BEGIN NOW Are you not happy in your home you
poor little naughty boy? END
BEGIN NOW I do wish I could do something for you. END
BEGIN NOW Please
tell me what you think of poor me. END
BEGIN NOW I often think of the beautiful name you
have. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Henry, when will we meet? END
BEGIN NOW I think of you so often you have no
idea. END
BEGIN NOW I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you. END
BEGIN NOW I feel so
bad about. END
BEGIN NOW Please write me a long letter and tell me more. END
BEGIN NOW Remember if you
do not I will punish you. END
BEGIN NOW So now you know what I will do to you, you
naughty boy, if you do not wrote. END
BEGIN NOW O how I long to meet you. END
BEGIN NOW Henry dear, do
not deny my request before my patience are exhausted. END
BEGIN NOW Then I will tell you
all. END
BEGIN NOW Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache. END
BEGIN NOW today. END
BEGIN NOW and
write BY RETURN to your longing


    Martha

P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. END
BEGIN NOW I want to know. END
BEGIN NOW He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell
and placed it in his heart pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Language of flowers. END
BEGIN NOW They like it
because no-one can hear. END
BEGIN NOW Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. END
BEGIN NOW Then
walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there
a word. END
BEGIN NOW Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you
don't please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we
soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha's perfume. END
BEGIN NOW Having
read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his
sidepocket. END
BEGIN NOW Weak joy opened his lips. END
BEGIN NOW Changed since the first letter. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder
did she wrote it herself. END
BEGIN NOW Doing the indignant: a girl of good
family like me, respectable character. END
BEGIN NOW Could meet one Sunday after the
rosary. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you: not having any. END
BEGIN NOW Usual love scrimmage. END
BEGIN NOW Then running
round corners. END
BEGIN NOW Bad as a row with Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Cigar has a cooling effect. END
BEGIN NOW Narcotic. END
BEGIN NOW Go further next time. END
BEGIN NOW Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of
course. END
BEGIN NOW Brutal, why not? END
BEGIN NOW Try it anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW A bit at a time. END
BEGIN NOW Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Common pin, eh? END
BEGIN NOW He threw it on the road. END
BEGIN NOW Out of her clothes somewhere:
pinned together. END
BEGIN NOW Queer the number of pins they always have. END
BEGIN NOW No roses
without thorns. END
BEGIN NOW Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. END
BEGIN NOW Those two sluts that night in
the Coombe, linked together in the rain. END
BEGIN NOW O, MARY LOST THE PIN OF HER DRAWERS. END
BEGIN NOW SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
    TO KEEP IT UP
    TO KEEP IT UP. END
BEGIN NOW It? END
BEGIN NOW Them. END
BEGIN NOW Such a bad headache. END
BEGIN NOW Has her roses probably. END
BEGIN NOW Or sitting all day
typing. END
BEGIN NOW Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. END
BEGIN NOW What perfume does your wife
use. END
BEGIN NOW Now could you make out a thing like that? END
BEGIN NOW TO KEEP IT UP. END
BEGIN NOW Martha, Mary. END
BEGIN NOW I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or
faked for money. END
BEGIN NOW He is sitting in their house, talking. END
BEGIN NOW Mysterious. END
BEGIN NOW Also
the two sluts in the Coombe would listen. END
BEGIN NOW TO KEEP IT UP. END
BEGIN NOW Nice kind of evening feeling. END
BEGIN NOW No more wandering about. END
BEGIN NOW Just loll there:
quiet dusk: let everything rip. END
BEGIN NOW Forget. END
BEGIN NOW Tell about places you have been,
strange customs. END
BEGIN NOW The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper:
fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in
the wall at Ashtown. END
BEGIN NOW Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the
trottingmatches. END
BEGIN NOW She listens with big dark soft eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Tell her: more and
more: all. END
BEGIN NOW Then a sigh: silence. END
BEGIN NOW Long long long rest. END
BEGIN NOW Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly
in shreds and scattered them towards the road. END
BEGIN NOW The shreds fluttered away,
sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank. END
BEGIN NOW Henry Flower. END
BEGIN NOW You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in
the same way. END
BEGIN NOW Simple bit of paper. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure
cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Shows you the money to be
made out of porter. END
BEGIN NOW Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change
his shirt four times a day, they say. END
BEGIN NOW Skin breeds lice or vermin. END
BEGIN NOW A
million pounds, wait a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,
eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter. END
BEGIN NOW One and four into twenty: fifteen about. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen millions of
barrels of porter. END
BEGIN NOW What am I saying barrels? END
BEGIN NOW Gallons. END
BEGIN NOW About a million barrels all the same. END
BEGIN NOW An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach. END
BEGIN NOW Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. END
BEGIN NOW The
bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together,
winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of
liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth. END
BEGIN NOW He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. END
BEGIN NOW Stepping into the
porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again
behind the leather headband. END
BEGIN NOW Damn it. END
BEGIN NOW I might have tried to work M'Coy
for a pass to Mullingar. END
BEGIN NOW Same notice on the door. END
BEGIN NOW Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee
S.J. END

heathen Chinee. END
BEGIN NOW Prefer an ounce of opium. END
BEGIN NOW Celestials. END
BEGIN NOW Rank heresy for
them. END
BEGIN NOW Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. END
BEGIN NOW Taking it easy
with hand under his cheek. END
BEGIN NOW Josssticks burning. END
BEGIN NOW Not like Ecce Homo. END
BEGIN NOW Crown
of thorns and cross. END
BEGIN NOW Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. END
BEGIN NOW Chopsticks? END
BEGIN NOW Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry I
didn't work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father
Farley who looked a fool but wasn't. END
BEGIN NOW They're taught that. END
BEGIN NOW He's not going
out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is
he? END
BEGIN NOW The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. END
BEGIN NOW Like to see them sitting
round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. END
BEGIN NOW Still life. END
BEGIN NOW Lap it
up like milk, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW The cold smell of sacred stone called him. END
BEGIN NOW He trod the worn steps,
pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere. END
BEGIN NOW Something going on: some sodality. END
BEGIN NOW Pity so empty. END
BEGIN NOW Nice discreet place
to be next some girl. END
BEGIN NOW Who is my neighbour? END
BEGIN NOW Jammed by the hour to slow

BEGIN NOW That woman at midnight mass. END
BEGIN NOW Seventh heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Women knelt in the
benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. END
BEGIN NOW A batch knelt
at the altarrails. END
BEGIN NOW The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the
thing in his hands. END
BEGIN NOW He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a
drop or two (are they in water?) END
BEGIN NOW off it and put it neatly into her mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Her hat and head sank. END
BEGIN NOW Then the next one. END
BEGIN NOW Her hat sank at once. END
BEGIN NOW Then the
next one: a small old woman. END
BEGIN NOW The priest bent down to put it into her
mouth, murmuring all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Latin. END
BEGIN NOW The next one. END
BEGIN NOW Shut your eyes and
open your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW CORPUS: body. END
BEGIN NOW Corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Good idea the Latin. END
BEGIN NOW Stupefies them first. END
BEGIN NOW Hospice for the dying. END
BEGIN NOW They don't seem to chew it:
only swallow it down. END
BEGIN NOW Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Why the cannibals
cotton to it. END
BEGIN NOW He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
one, and seek their places. END
BEGIN NOW He approached a bench and seated himself in
its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. END
BEGIN NOW These pots we have to wear. END
BEGIN NOW We
ought to have hats modelled on our heads. END
BEGIN NOW They were about him here and
there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to
melt in their stomachs. END
BEGIN NOW Something like those mazzoth: it's that sort of
bread: unleavened shewbread. END
BEGIN NOW Look at them. END
BEGIN NOW Now I bet it makes them feel
happy. END
BEGIN NOW Lollipop. END
BEGIN NOW It does. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, bread of angels it's called. END
BEGIN NOW There's a big
idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. END
BEGIN NOW First
communicants. END
BEGIN NOW Hokypoky penny a lump. END
BEGIN NOW Then feel all like one family party,
same in the theatre, all in the same swim. END
BEGIN NOW They do. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure of that. END
BEGIN NOW Not
so lonely. END
BEGIN NOW In our confraternity. END
BEGIN NOW Then come out a bit spreeish. END
BEGIN NOW Let off
steam. END
BEGIN NOW Thing is if you really believe in it. END
BEGIN NOW Lourdes cure, waters of
oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. END
BEGIN NOW Old fellow asleep
near that confessionbox. END
BEGIN NOW Hence those snores. END
BEGIN NOW Blind faith. END
BEGIN NOW Safe in the arms
of kingdom come. END
BEGIN NOW Lulls all pain. END
BEGIN NOW Wake this time next year. END
BEGIN NOW He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel
an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
affair he had on. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose he lost the pin of his. END
BEGIN NOW He wouldn't know what to
do to. END
BEGIN NOW Bald spot behind. END
BEGIN NOW Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? END
BEGIN NOW No: I.H.S. END
BEGIN NOW Molly told me one time I asked her. END
BEGIN NOW I have sinned: or no: I have suffered,
it is. END
BEGIN NOW And the other one? END
BEGIN NOW Iron nails ran in. END
BEGIN NOW Meet one Sunday after the rosary. END
BEGIN NOW Do not deny my request. END
BEGIN NOW Turn up
with a veil and black bag. END
BEGIN NOW Dusk and the light behind her. END
BEGIN NOW She might be
here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on
the sly. END
BEGIN NOW Their character. END
BEGIN NOW That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the
invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion
every morning. END
BEGIN NOW This very church. END
BEGIN NOW Peter Carey, yes. END
BEGIN NOW No, Peter Claver I am
thinking of. END
BEGIN NOW Denis Carey. END
BEGIN NOW And just imagine that. END
BEGIN NOW Wife and six children
at home. END
BEGIN NOW And plotting that murder all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Those crawthumpers,
now that's a good name for them, there's always something shiftylooking
about them. END
BEGIN NOW They're not straight men of business either. END
BEGIN NOW O, no, she's
not here: the flower: no, no. END
BEGIN NOW By the way, did I tear up that envelope? END
BEGIN NOW Yes: under the bridge. END
BEGIN NOW The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
smartly. END
BEGIN NOW Wine. END
BEGIN NOW Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank
what they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage
Wheatley's Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale
(aromatic). END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. END
BEGIN NOW Cold
comfort. END
BEGIN NOW Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they'd have one old booser
worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW Queer the whole
atmosphere of the. END
BEGIN NOW Quite right. END
BEGIN NOW Perfectly right that is. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. END
BEGIN NOW Not going to be any music. END
BEGIN NOW Pity. END
BEGIN NOW Who has the organ here I wonder? END
BEGIN NOW Old Glynn he knew how to make
that instrument talk, the VIBRATO: fifty pounds a year they say he had in
Gardiner street. END
BEGIN NOW Molly was in fine voice that day, the STABAT MATER of
Rossini. END
BEGIN NOW Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. END
BEGIN NOW Christ or Pilate? END
BEGIN NOW Christ,
but don't keep us all night over it. END
BEGIN NOW Music they wanted. END
BEGIN NOW Footdrill stopped. END
BEGIN NOW Could hear a pin drop. END
BEGIN NOW I told her to pitch her voice against that corner. END
BEGIN NOW I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:

QUIS EST HOMO. END
BEGIN NOW Some of that old sacred music splendid. END
BEGIN NOW Mercadante: seven last
words. END
BEGIN NOW Mozart's twelfth mass: GLORIA in that. END
BEGIN NOW Those old popes keen on
music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. END
BEGIN NOW Palestrina for
example too. END
BEGIN NOW They had a gay old time while it lasted. END
BEGIN NOW Healthy too,
chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs. END
BEGIN NOW Benedictine. END
BEGIN NOW Green
Chartreuse. END
BEGIN NOW Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit
thick. END
BEGIN NOW What kind of voice is it? END
BEGIN NOW Must be curious to hear after their own
strong basses. END
BEGIN NOW Connoisseurs. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of a placid. END
BEGIN NOW No worry. END
BEGIN NOW Fall into flesh, don't they? END
BEGIN NOW Gluttons, tall,
long legs. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows? END
BEGIN NOW Eunuch. END
BEGIN NOW One way out of it. END
BEGIN NOW He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about
and bless all the people. END
BEGIN NOW All crossed themselves and stood up. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom
glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. END
BEGIN NOW Stand up
at the gospel of course. END
BEGIN NOW Then all settled down on their knees again and he
sat back quietly in his bench. END
BEGIN NOW The priest came down from the altar,
holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other
in Latin. END
BEGIN NOW Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:

--O God, our refuge and our strength ...

Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. END
BEGIN NOW English. END
BEGIN NOW Throw
them the bone. END
BEGIN NOW I remember slightly. END
BEGIN NOW How long since your last mass? END
BEGIN NOW Glorious and immaculate virgin. END
BEGIN NOW Joseph, her spouse. END
BEGIN NOW Peter and Paul. END
BEGIN NOW More
interesting if you understood what it was all about. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful
organisation certainly, goes like clockwork. END
BEGIN NOW Confession. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone wants
to. END
BEGIN NOW Then I will tell you all. END
BEGIN NOW Penance. END
BEGIN NOW Punish me, please. END
BEGIN NOW Great weapon in
their hands. END
BEGIN NOW More than doctor or solicitor. END
BEGIN NOW Woman dying to. END
BEGIN NOW And I
schschschschschsch. END
BEGIN NOW And did you chachachachacha? END
BEGIN NOW And why did you? END
BEGIN NOW Look
down at her ring to find an excuse. END
BEGIN NOW Whispering gallery walls have ears. END
BEGIN NOW Husband learn to his surprise. END
BEGIN NOW God's little joke. END
BEGIN NOW Then out she comes. END
BEGIN NOW Repentance skindeep. END
BEGIN NOW Lovely shame. END
BEGIN NOW Pray at an altar. END
BEGIN NOW Hail Mary and
Holy Mary. END
BEGIN NOW Flowers, incense, candles melting. END
BEGIN NOW Hide her blushes. END
BEGIN NOW Salvation army blatant imitation. END
BEGIN NOW Reformed prostitute will address
the meeting. END
BEGIN NOW How I found the Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Squareheaded chaps those must be
in Rome: they work the whole show. END
BEGIN NOW And don't they rake in the money too? END
BEGIN NOW Bequests also: to the P.P. END
BEGIN NOW for the time being in his absolute discretion. END
BEGIN NOW Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors. END
BEGIN NOW Monasteries and convents. END
BEGIN NOW The priest in that Fermanagh will case in
the witnessbox. END
BEGIN NOW No browbeating him. END
BEGIN NOW He had his answer pat for everything. END
BEGIN NOW Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. END
BEGIN NOW The doctors of the
church: they mapped out the whole theology of it. END
BEGIN NOW The priest prayed:

--Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. END
BEGIN NOW Be our
safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain
him, we humbly pray! END
BEGIN NOW ): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the
power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked
spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. END
BEGIN NOW The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. END
BEGIN NOW All over. END
BEGIN NOW The
women remained behind: thanksgiving. END
BEGIN NOW Better be shoving along. END
BEGIN NOW Brother Buzz. END
BEGIN NOW Come around with the plate
perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Pay your Easter duty. END
BEGIN NOW He stood up. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END
BEGIN NOW Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all
the time? END
BEGIN NOW Women enjoy it. END
BEGIN NOW Never tell you. END
BEGIN NOW But we. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse, miss, there's a
(whh!) END
BEGIN NOW just a (whh!) END
BEGIN NOW fluff. END
BEGIN NOW Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked. END
BEGIN NOW Glimpses of the moon. END
BEGIN NOW Annoyed if you don't. END
BEGIN NOW Why didn't you tell me
before. END
BEGIN NOW Still like you better untidy. END
BEGIN NOW Good job it wasn't farther south. END
BEGIN NOW He
passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door
into the light. END
BEGIN NOW He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl
while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the
low tide of holy water. END
BEGIN NOW Trams: a car of Prescott's dyeworks: a widow in
her  weeds. END
BEGIN NOW Notice because I'm in mourning myself. END
BEGIN NOW He covered himself. END
BEGIN NOW How
goes the time? END
BEGIN NOW Quarter past. END
BEGIN NOW Time enough yet. END
BEGIN NOW Better get that lotion made
up. END
BEGIN NOW Where is this? END
BEGIN NOW Ah yes, the last time. END
BEGIN NOW Sweny's in Lincoln place. END
BEGIN NOW Chemists rarely move. END
BEGIN NOW Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir. END
BEGIN NOW Hamilton Long's, founded in the year of the flood. END
BEGIN NOW Huguenot churchyard
near there. END
BEGIN NOW Visit some day. END
BEGIN NOW He walked southward along Westland row. END
BEGIN NOW But the recipe is in the
other trousers. END
BEGIN NOW O, and I forgot that latchkey too. END
BEGIN NOW Bore this funeral
affair. END
BEGIN NOW O well, poor fellow, it's not his fault. END
BEGIN NOW When was it I got it made
up last? END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW I changed a sovereign I remember. END
BEGIN NOW First of the month it
must have been or the second. END
BEGIN NOW O, he can look it up in the prescriptions
book. END
BEGIN NOW The chemist turned back page after page. END
BEGIN NOW Sandy shrivelled smell he
seems to have. END
BEGIN NOW Shrunken skull. END
BEGIN NOW And old. END
BEGIN NOW Quest for the philosopher's stone. END
BEGIN NOW The alchemists. END
BEGIN NOW Drugs age you after mental excitement. END
BEGIN NOW Lethargy then. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Reaction. END
BEGIN NOW A lifetime in a night. END
BEGIN NOW Gradually changes your character. END
BEGIN NOW Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. END
BEGIN NOW All his
alabaster lilypots. END
BEGIN NOW Mortar and pestle. END
BEGIN NOW Aq. END
BEGIN NOW Dist. END
BEGIN NOW Fol. END
BEGIN NOW Laur. END
BEGIN NOW Te Virid. END
BEGIN NOW Smell almost cure you like the dentist's doorbell. END
BEGIN NOW Doctor Whack. END
BEGIN NOW He ought
to physic himself a bit. END
BEGIN NOW Electuary or emulsion. END
BEGIN NOW The first fellow that
picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. END
BEGIN NOW Simples. END
BEGIN NOW Want to be
careful. END
BEGIN NOW Enough stuff here to chloroform you. END
BEGIN NOW Test: turns blue litmus
paper red. END
BEGIN NOW Chloroform. END
BEGIN NOW Overdose of laudanum. END
BEGIN NOW Sleeping draughts. END
BEGIN NOW Lovephiltres. END
BEGIN NOW Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. END
BEGIN NOW Clogs the pores or the
phlegm. END
BEGIN NOW Poisons the only cures. END
BEGIN NOW Remedy where you least expect it. END
BEGIN NOW Clever
of nature. END
BEGIN NOW --About a fortnight ago, sir? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the
dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. END
BEGIN NOW Lot of time taken up telling your
aches and pains. END
BEGIN NOW --Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
orangeflower water ... END
BEGIN NOW It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax. END
BEGIN NOW --And white wax also, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Brings out the darkness of her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Looking at me, the sheet up to
her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my
cuffs. END
BEGIN NOW Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the
teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW Skinfood. END
BEGIN NOW One of the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? END
BEGIN NOW had only one
skin. END
BEGIN NOW Leopold, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Three we have. END
BEGIN NOW Warts, bunions and pimples to make it
worse. END
BEGIN NOW But you want a perfume too. END
BEGIN NOW What perfume does your? END
BEGIN NOW PEAU D'ESPAGNE. END
BEGIN NOW That orangeflower water is so fresh. END
BEGIN NOW Nice smell these soaps have. END
BEGIN NOW Pure
curd soap. END
BEGIN NOW Time to get a bath round the corner. END
BEGIN NOW Hammam. END
BEGIN NOW Turkish. END
BEGIN NOW Massage. END
BEGIN NOW Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. END
BEGIN NOW Nicer if a nice girl did it. END
BEGIN NOW Also I
think I. END
BEGIN NOW Yes I. END
BEGIN NOW Do it in the bath. END
BEGIN NOW Curious longing I. END
BEGIN NOW Water to water. END
BEGIN NOW Combine business with pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Pity no time for massage. END
BEGIN NOW Feel fresh then
all the day. END
BEGIN NOW Funeral be rather glum. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir, the chemist said. END
BEGIN NOW That was two and nine. END
BEGIN NOW Have you brought a
bottle? END
BEGIN NOW --No, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Make it up, please. END
BEGIN NOW I'll call later in the day and
I'll take one of these soaps. END
BEGIN NOW How much are they? END
BEGIN NOW --Fourpence, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet lemony wax. END
BEGIN NOW --I'll take this one, he said. END
BEGIN NOW That makes three and a penny. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir, the chemist said. END
BEGIN NOW You can pay all together, sir, when you
come back. END
BEGIN NOW --Good, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit,
the coolwrappered soap in his left hand. END
BEGIN NOW At his armpit Bantam Lyons' voice and hand said:

--Hello, Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW What's the best news? END
BEGIN NOW Is that today's? END
BEGIN NOW Show us a minute. END
BEGIN NOW Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! END
BEGIN NOW Long cold upper lip. END
BEGIN NOW To
look younger. END
BEGIN NOW He does look balmy. END
BEGIN NOW Younger than I am. END
BEGIN NOW Bantam Lyons's yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. END
BEGIN NOW Wants
a wash too. END
BEGIN NOW Take off the rough dirt. END
BEGIN NOW Good morning, have you used Pears'
soap? END
BEGIN NOW Dandruff on his shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Scalp wants oiling. END
BEGIN NOW --I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam
Lyons said. END
BEGIN NOW Where the bugger is it? END
BEGIN NOW He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar. END
BEGIN NOW Barber's itch. END
BEGIN NOW Tight collar he'll lose his hair. END
BEGIN NOW Better leave him the
paper and get shut of him. END
BEGIN NOW --You can keep it, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW --Ascot. END
BEGIN NOW Gold cup. END
BEGIN NOW Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. END
BEGIN NOW Half a mo. END
BEGIN NOW Maximum
the second. END
BEGIN NOW --I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly. END
BEGIN NOW --What's that? END
BEGIN NOW his sharp voice said. END
BEGIN NOW --I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. END
BEGIN NOW I was going to throw it away
that moment. END
BEGIN NOW Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
sheets back on Mr Bloom's arms. END
BEGIN NOW --I'll risk it, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Here, thanks. END
BEGIN NOW He sped off towards Conway's corner. END
BEGIN NOW God speed scut. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the
soap in it, smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Silly lips of that chap. END
BEGIN NOW Betting. END
BEGIN NOW Regular hotbed of
it lately. END
BEGIN NOW Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. END
BEGIN NOW Raffle for large
tender turkey. END
BEGIN NOW Your Christmas dinner for threepence. END
BEGIN NOW Jack Fleming
embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. END
BEGIN NOW Keeps a hotel now. END
BEGIN NOW They
never come back. END
BEGIN NOW Fleshpots of Egypt. END
BEGIN NOW He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. END
BEGIN NOW Remind you
of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. END
BEGIN NOW College sports today I see. END
BEGIN NOW He
eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled
up like a cod in a pot. END
BEGIN NOW Damn bad ad. END
BEGIN NOW Now if they had made it round like a
wheel. END
BEGIN NOW Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college. END
BEGIN NOW Something to catch the eye. END
BEGIN NOW There's Hornblower standing at the porter's lodge. END
BEGIN NOW Keep him on
hands: might take a turn in there on the nod. END
BEGIN NOW How do you do, Mr
Hornblower? END
BEGIN NOW How do you do, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Heavenly weather really. END
BEGIN NOW If life was always like that. END
BEGIN NOW Cricket weather. END
BEGIN NOW Sit around under sunshades. END
BEGIN NOW Over after over. END
BEGIN NOW Out. END
BEGIN NOW They can't play it here. END
BEGIN NOW Duck for six wickets. END
BEGIN NOW Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare
street club with a slog to square leg. END
BEGIN NOW Donnybrook fair more in their line. END
BEGIN NOW And the skulls we were acracking when M'Carthy took the floor. END
BEGIN NOW Heatwave. END
BEGIN NOW Won't last. END
BEGIN NOW Always passing, the stream of life, which in the
stream of life we trace is dearer than them all. END
BEGIN NOW Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle
tepid stream. END
BEGIN NOW This is my body. END
BEGIN NOW He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. END
BEGIN NOW He saw his trunk and
limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow:
his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush
floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands,
a languid floating flower. END
BEGIN NOW * * * * * * *


Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power stepped in after
him, curving his height with care. END
BEGIN NOW --Come on, Simon. END
BEGIN NOW --After you, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:

Yes, yes. END
BEGIN NOW --Are we all here now? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham asked. END
BEGIN NOW Come along, Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. END
BEGIN NOW He pulled the door to
after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. END
BEGIN NOW He passed an arm
through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at
the lowered blinds of the avenue. END
BEGIN NOW One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. END
BEGIN NOW Nose whiteflattened against the pane. END
BEGIN NOW Thanking her stars she was passed
over. END
BEGIN NOW Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Glad to see us go
we give them such trouble coming. END
BEGIN NOW Job seems to suit them. END
BEGIN NOW Huggermugger in
corners. END
BEGIN NOW Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd wake. END
BEGIN NOW Then getting it
ready. END
BEGIN NOW Laying it out. END
BEGIN NOW Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Pull it more
to your side. END
BEGIN NOW Our windingsheet. END
BEGIN NOW Never know who will touch you dead. END
BEGIN NOW Wash and shampoo. END
BEGIN NOW I believe they clip the nails and the hair. END
BEGIN NOW Keep a bit
in an envelope. END
BEGIN NOW Grows all the same after. END
BEGIN NOW Unclean job. END
BEGIN NOW All waited. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing was said. END
BEGIN NOW Stowing in the wreaths probably. END
BEGIN NOW I am
sitting on something hard. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Better shift
it out of that. END
BEGIN NOW Wait for an opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW All waited. END
BEGIN NOW Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then
nearer: then horses' hoofs. END
BEGIN NOW A jolt. END
BEGIN NOW Their carriage began to move, creaking
and swaying. END
BEGIN NOW Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. END
BEGIN NOW The blinds
of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. END
BEGIN NOW At walking pace. END
BEGIN NOW They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
passing along the tramtracks. END
BEGIN NOW Tritonville road. END
BEGIN NOW Quicker. END
BEGIN NOW The wheels
rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
rattling in the doorframes. END
BEGIN NOW --What way is he taking us? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked through both windows. END
BEGIN NOW --Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Ringsend. END
BEGIN NOW Brunswick street. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out. END
BEGIN NOW --That's a fine old custom, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad to see it has not died out. END
BEGIN NOW All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
passers. END
BEGIN NOW Respect. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother
road past Watery lane. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in
mourning, a wide hat. END
BEGIN NOW --There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --Who is that? END
BEGIN NOW --Your son and heir. END
BEGIN NOW --Where is he? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup
roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and,
swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:

--Was that Mulligan cad with him? END
BEGIN NOW His FIDUS ACHATES! END
BEGIN NOW --No, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He was alone. END
BEGIN NOW --Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump of
dung, the wise child that knows her own father. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. END
BEGIN NOW Wallace Bros: the
bottleworks: Dodder bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Richie Goulding and the legal bag. END
BEGIN NOW Goulding, Collis and Ward he
calls the firm. END
BEGIN NOW His jokes are getting a bit damp. END
BEGIN NOW Great card he was. END
BEGIN NOW Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
landlady's two hats pinned on his head. END
BEGIN NOW Out on the rampage all night. END
BEGIN NOW Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. END
BEGIN NOW Wife ironing
his back. END
BEGIN NOW Thinks he'll cure it with pills. END
BEGIN NOW All breadcrumbs they are. END
BEGIN NOW About six hundred per cent profit. END
BEGIN NOW --He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. END
BEGIN NOW That Mulligan is a
contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. END
BEGIN NOW His name stinks
all over Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll make
it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his
aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. END
BEGIN NOW I'll
tickle his catastrophe, believe you me. END
BEGIN NOW He cried above the clatter of the wheels:

--I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. END
BEGIN NOW A counterjumper's
son. END
BEGIN NOW Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. END
BEGIN NOW Not likely. END
BEGIN NOW He ceased. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's
mild face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. END
BEGIN NOW Noisy selfwilled man. END
BEGIN NOW Full of his son. END
BEGIN NOW He is right. END
BEGIN NOW Something to
hand on. END
BEGIN NOW If little Rudy had lived. END
BEGIN NOW See him grow up. END
BEGIN NOW Hear his voice in the
house. END
BEGIN NOW Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. END
BEGIN NOW My son. END
BEGIN NOW Me in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Strange feeling it would be. END
BEGIN NOW From me. END
BEGIN NOW Just a chance. END
BEGIN NOW Must have been that
morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs
at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. END
BEGIN NOW And the sergeant grinning up. END
BEGIN NOW She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. END
BEGIN NOW Give us a
touch, Poldy. END
BEGIN NOW God, I'm dying for it. END
BEGIN NOW How life begins. END
BEGIN NOW Got big then. END
BEGIN NOW Had to refuse the Greystones concert. END
BEGIN NOW My son inside
her. END
BEGIN NOW I could have helped him on in life. END
BEGIN NOW I could. END
BEGIN NOW Make him independent. END
BEGIN NOW Learn German too. END
BEGIN NOW --Are we late? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch. END
BEGIN NOW Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Milly. END
BEGIN NOW Same thing watered down. END
BEGIN NOW Her tomboy oaths. END
BEGIN NOW O jumping
Jupiter! END
BEGIN NOW Ye gods and little fishes! END
BEGIN NOW Still, she's a dear girl. END
BEGIN NOW Soon
be a woman. END
BEGIN NOW Mullingar. END
BEGIN NOW Dearest Papli. END
BEGIN NOW Young student. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes: a woman
too. END
BEGIN NOW Life, life. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying. END
BEGIN NOW --Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW --He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. END
BEGIN NOW Do
you follow me? END
BEGIN NOW He closed his left eye. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham began to brush away
crustcrumbs from under his thighs. END
BEGIN NOW --What is this, he said, in the name of God? END
BEGIN NOW Crumbs? END
BEGIN NOW --Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
said. END
BEGIN NOW All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed
buttonless leather of the seats. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned
downward and said:

--Unless I'm greatly mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think, Martin? END
BEGIN NOW --It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom set his thigh down. END
BEGIN NOW Glad I took that bath. END
BEGIN NOW Feel my feet
quite clean. END
BEGIN NOW But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly. END
BEGIN NOW --After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world. END
BEGIN NOW --Did Tom Kernan turn up? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak
of his beard gently. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mr Bloom answered. END
BEGIN NOW He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes. END
BEGIN NOW --And Corny Kelleher himself? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked. END
BEGIN NOW --At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW --I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He said he'd try to come. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage halted short. END
BEGIN NOW --What's wrong? END
BEGIN NOW --We're stopped. END
BEGIN NOW --Where are we? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom put his head out of the window. END
BEGIN NOW --The grand canal, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Gasworks. END
BEGIN NOW Whooping cough they say it cures. END
BEGIN NOW Good job Milly never
got it. END
BEGIN NOW Poor children! END
BEGIN NOW Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. END
BEGIN NOW Shame really. END
BEGIN NOW Got off lightly with illnesses compared. END
BEGIN NOW Only measles. END
BEGIN NOW Flaxseed tea. END
BEGIN NOW Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. END
BEGIN NOW Canvassing for death. END
BEGIN NOW Don't
miss this chance. END
BEGIN NOW Dogs' home over there. END
BEGIN NOW Poor old Athos! END
BEGIN NOW Be good to Athos,
Leopold, is my last wish. END
BEGIN NOW Thy will be done. END
BEGIN NOW We obey them in the grave. END
BEGIN NOW A
dying scrawl. END
BEGIN NOW He took it to heart, pined away. END
BEGIN NOW Quiet brute. END
BEGIN NOW Old men's dogs
usually are. END
BEGIN NOW A raindrop spat on his hat. END
BEGIN NOW He drew back and saw an instant of
shower spray dots over the grey flags. END
BEGIN NOW Apart. END
BEGIN NOW Curious. END
BEGIN NOW Like through a
colander. END
BEGIN NOW I thought it would. END
BEGIN NOW My boots were creaking I remember now. END
BEGIN NOW --The weather is changing, he said quietly. END
BEGIN NOW --A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW --Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW There's the sun again coming out. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun,
hurled a mute curse at the sky. END
BEGIN NOW --It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --We're off again. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
gently. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard. END
BEGIN NOW --Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. END
BEGIN NOW And Paddy Leonard taking
him off to his face. END
BEGIN NOW --O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. END
BEGIN NOW Wait till you hear him,
Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of THE CROPPY BOY. END
BEGIN NOW --Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. END
BEGIN NOW HIS SINGING OF THAT SIMPLE
BALLAD, MARTIN, IS THE MOST TRENCHANT RENDERING I EVER HEARD IN THE WHOLE
COURSE OF MY EXPERIENCE. END
BEGIN NOW --Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. END
BEGIN NOW He's dead nuts on that. END
BEGIN NOW And the
retrospective arrangement. END
BEGIN NOW --Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham asked. END
BEGIN NOW --I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Where is it? END
BEGIN NOW --In the paper this morning. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. END
BEGIN NOW That book I must
change for her. END
BEGIN NOW --No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. END
BEGIN NOW Later on please. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
Peake is that? END
BEGIN NOW is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? END
BEGIN NOW no, Sexton,
Urbright. END
BEGIN NOW Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks to the Little Flower. END
BEGIN NOW Sadly missed. END
BEGIN NOW To the inexpressible grief of
his. END
BEGIN NOW Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. END
BEGIN NOW Month's mind: Quinlan. END
BEGIN NOW On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy. END
BEGIN NOW IT IS NOW A MONTH SINCE DEAR HENRY FLED
    TO HIS HOME UP ABOVE IN THE SKY
    WHILE HIS FAMILY WEEPS AND MOURNS HIS LOSS
    HOPING SOME DAY TO MEET HIM ON HIGH. END
BEGIN NOW I tore up the envelope? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Where did I put her letter after I read it in
the bath? END
BEGIN NOW He patted his waistcoatpocket. END
BEGIN NOW There all right. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Henry fled. END
BEGIN NOW Before my patience are exhausted. END
BEGIN NOW National school. END
BEGIN NOW Meade's yard. END
BEGIN NOW The hazard. END
BEGIN NOW Only two there now. END
BEGIN NOW Nodding. END
BEGIN NOW Full as a tick. END
BEGIN NOW Too much bone in their skulls. END
BEGIN NOW The other trotting
round with a fare. END
BEGIN NOW An hour ago I was passing there. END
BEGIN NOW The jarvies raised
their hats. END
BEGIN NOW A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't they invent something
automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? END
BEGIN NOW Well but that fellow
would lose his job then? END
BEGIN NOW Well but then another fellow would get a job
making the new invention? END
BEGIN NOW Antient concert rooms. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing on there. END
BEGIN NOW A man in a buff suit with a
crape armlet. END
BEGIN NOW Not much grief there. END
BEGIN NOW Quarter mourning. END
BEGIN NOW People in law
perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway
bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Hoardings: Eugene Stratton,
Mrs Bandmann Palmer. END
BEGIN NOW Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. END
BEGIN NOW I said I. END
BEGIN NOW Or the LILY OF KILLARNEY? END
BEGIN NOW Elster Grimes Opera Company. END
BEGIN NOW Big powerful
change. END
BEGIN NOW Wet bright bills for next week. END
BEGIN NOW FUN ON THE BRISTOL. END
BEGIN NOW Martin
Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. END
BEGIN NOW Have to stand a drink or
two. END
BEGIN NOW As broad as it's long. END
BEGIN NOW He's coming in the afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW Her songs. END
BEGIN NOW Plasto's. END
BEGIN NOW Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. END
BEGIN NOW Who was he? END
BEGIN NOW --How do you do? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow
in salute. END
BEGIN NOW --He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he does. END
BEGIN NOW How do you do? END
BEGIN NOW --Who? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW There he is airing his quiff. END
BEGIN NOW Just that moment I was thinking. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. END
BEGIN NOW From the door of the Red Bank the
white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
hand. END
BEGIN NOW The nails, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Is there anything more in him that they she sees? END
BEGIN NOW Fascination. END
BEGIN NOW Worst man in Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW That keeps him alive. END
BEGIN NOW They sometimes
feel what a person is. END
BEGIN NOW Instinct. END
BEGIN NOW But a type like that. END
BEGIN NOW My nails. END
BEGIN NOW I am just
looking at them: well pared. END
BEGIN NOW And after: thinking alone. END
BEGIN NOW Body getting a bit
softy. END
BEGIN NOW I would notice that: from remembering. END
BEGIN NOW What causes that? END
BEGIN NOW I suppose
the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. END
BEGIN NOW But the
shape is there. END
BEGIN NOW The shape is there still. END
BEGIN NOW Shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Hips. END
BEGIN NOW Plump. END
BEGIN NOW Night of
the dance dressing. END
BEGIN NOW Shift stuck between the cheeks behind. END
BEGIN NOW He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
glance over their faces. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked:

--How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW --O, very well, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW I hear great accounts of it. END
BEGIN NOW It's a good
idea, you see ...

--Are you going yourself? END
BEGIN NOW --Well no, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW In point of fact I have to go down to the
county Clare on some private business. END
BEGIN NOW You see the idea is to tour the
chief towns. END
BEGIN NOW What you lose on one you can make up on the other. END
BEGIN NOW --Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Mary Anderson is up there now. END
BEGIN NOW Have you good artists? END
BEGIN NOW --Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW O yes, we'll have all
topnobbers. END
BEGIN NOW J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. END
BEGIN NOW The best, in
fact. END
BEGIN NOW --And MADAME, Mr Power said smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Last but not least. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and
clasped them. END
BEGIN NOW Smith O'Brien. END
BEGIN NOW Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. END
BEGIN NOW Woman. END
BEGIN NOW Must be his deathday. END
BEGIN NOW For many happy returns. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage
wheeling by Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees. END
BEGIN NOW Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his
mouth opening: oot. END
BEGIN NOW --Four bootlaces for a penny. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. END
BEGIN NOW Had his office in Hume
street. END
BEGIN NOW Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for
Waterford. END
BEGIN NOW Has that silk hat ever since. END
BEGIN NOW Relics of old decency. END
BEGIN NOW Mourning
too. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible comedown, poor wretch! END
BEGIN NOW Kicked about like snuff at a wake. END
BEGIN NOW O'Callaghan on his last legs. END
BEGIN NOW And MADAME. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty past eleven. END
BEGIN NOW Up. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Fleming is in to clean. END
BEGIN NOW Doing her hair, humming. END
BEGIN NOW VOGLIO E NON VORREI. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW VORREI E NON. END
BEGIN NOW Looking
at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. END
BEGIN NOW MI TREMA UN POCO IL. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful on that TRE her voice is: weeping tone. END
BEGIN NOW A thrush. END
BEGIN NOW A throstle. END
BEGIN NOW There is a word throstle that expresses that. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. END
BEGIN NOW Greyish
over the ears. END
BEGIN NOW MADAME: smiling. END
BEGIN NOW I smiled back. END
BEGIN NOW A smile goes a long way. END
BEGIN NOW Only politeness perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Nice fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows is that true about the
woman he keeps? END
BEGIN NOW Not pleasant for the wife. END
BEGIN NOW Yet they say, who was it told
me, there is no carnal. END
BEGIN NOW You would imagine that would get played out pretty
quick. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of
rumpsteak. END
BEGIN NOW What is this she was? END
BEGIN NOW Barmaid in Jury's. END
BEGIN NOW Or the Moira, was it? END
BEGIN NOW They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power. END
BEGIN NOW --Of the tribe of Reuben, he said. END
BEGIN NOW A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
of Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine. END
BEGIN NOW --In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:

--The devil break the hasp of your back! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as
the carriage passed Gray's statue. END
BEGIN NOW --We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. END
BEGIN NOW He caressed his beard, adding:

--Well, nearly all of us. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces. END
BEGIN NOW --That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and
the son. END
BEGIN NOW --About the boatman? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't it awfully good? END
BEGIN NOW --What is that? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't hear it. END
BEGIN NOW --There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send
him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both ...

--What? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
to drown ...

--Drown Barabbas! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus cried. END
BEGIN NOW I wish to Christ he did! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils. END
BEGIN NOW --No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself ...

Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:

--Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their
way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and
over the wall with him into the Liffey. END
BEGIN NOW --For God's sake! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. END
BEGIN NOW Is he dead? END
BEGIN NOW --Dead! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham cried. END
BEGIN NOW Not he! END
BEGIN NOW A boatman got a pole and
fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the
father on the quay more dead than alive. END
BEGIN NOW Half the town was there. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW But the funny part is ...

--And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
saving his son's life. END
BEGIN NOW A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand. END
BEGIN NOW --O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. END
BEGIN NOW Like a hero. END
BEGIN NOW A silver florin. END
BEGIN NOW --Isn't it awfully good? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom said eagerly. END
BEGIN NOW --One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage. END
BEGIN NOW Nelson's pillar. END
BEGIN NOW --Eight plums a penny! END
BEGIN NOW Eight for a penny! END
BEGIN NOW --We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus sighed. END
BEGIN NOW --Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh. END
BEGIN NOW Many a good one he told himself. END
BEGIN NOW --The Lord forgive me! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Paddy! END
BEGIN NOW I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and
he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. END
BEGIN NOW He's
gone from us. END
BEGIN NOW --As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW He went
very suddenly. END
BEGIN NOW --Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Heart. END
BEGIN NOW He tapped his chest sadly. END
BEGIN NOW Blazing face: redhot. END
BEGIN NOW Too much John Barleycorn. END
BEGIN NOW Cure for a red
nose. END
BEGIN NOW Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of money he spent
colouring it. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension. END
BEGIN NOW --He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --The best death, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Their wide open eyes looked at him. END
BEGIN NOW --No suffering, he said. END
BEGIN NOW A moment and all is over. END
BEGIN NOW Like dying in sleep. END
BEGIN NOW No-one spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Dead side of the street this. END
BEGIN NOW Dull business by day, land agents,
temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college, Gill's,
catholic club, the industrious blind. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Some reason. END
BEGIN NOW Sun or wind. END
BEGIN NOW At
night too. END
BEGIN NOW Chummies and slaveys. END
BEGIN NOW Under the patronage of the late Father
Mathew. END
BEGIN NOW Foundation stone for Parnell. END
BEGIN NOW Breakdown. END
BEGIN NOW Heart. END
BEGIN NOW White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda
corner, galloping. END
BEGIN NOW A tiny coffin flashed by. END
BEGIN NOW In a hurry to bury. END
BEGIN NOW A
mourning coach. END
BEGIN NOW Unmarried. END
BEGIN NOW Black for the married. END
BEGIN NOW Piebald for bachelors. END
BEGIN NOW Dun for a nun. END
BEGIN NOW --Sad, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW A child. END
BEGIN NOW A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. END
BEGIN NOW Dwarf's
body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. END
BEGIN NOW Burial friendly society
pays. END
BEGIN NOW Penny a week for a sod of turf. END
BEGIN NOW Our. END
BEGIN NOW Little. END
BEGIN NOW Beggar. END
BEGIN NOW Baby. END
BEGIN NOW Meant nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Mistake of nature. END
BEGIN NOW If it's healthy it's from the mother. END
BEGIN NOW If not from the man. END
BEGIN NOW Better luck next time. END
BEGIN NOW --Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW It's well out of it. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. END
BEGIN NOW Rattle
his bones. END
BEGIN NOW Over the stones. END
BEGIN NOW Only a pauper. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody owns. END
BEGIN NOW --In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW --But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back. END
BEGIN NOW --The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added. END
BEGIN NOW --Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. END
BEGIN NOW We
must take a charitable view of it. END
BEGIN NOW --They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW --It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham's
large eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Looking away now. END
BEGIN NOW Sympathetic human man he is. END
BEGIN NOW Intelligent. END
BEGIN NOW Like Shakespeare's face. END
BEGIN NOW Always a good word to say. END
BEGIN NOW They have no
mercy on that here or infanticide. END
BEGIN NOW Refuse christian burial. END
BEGIN NOW They
used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. END
BEGIN NOW As if it
wasn't broken already. END
BEGIN NOW Yet sometimes they repent too late. END
BEGIN NOW Found in the
riverbed clutching rushes. END
BEGIN NOW He looked at me. END
BEGIN NOW And that awful drunkard of a
wife of his. END
BEGIN NOW Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the
furniture on him every Saturday almost. END
BEGIN NOW Leading him the life of the
damned. END
BEGIN NOW Wear the heart out of a stone, that. END
BEGIN NOW Monday morning. END
BEGIN NOW Start afresh. END
BEGIN NOW Shoulder to the wheel. END
BEGIN NOW Lord, she must have looked a sight that night
Dedalus told me he was in there. END
BEGIN NOW Drunk about the place and capering with
Martin's umbrella. END
BEGIN NOW AND THEY CALL ME THE JEWEL OF ASIA,
    OF ASIA,
    THE GEISHA. END
BEGIN NOW He looked away from me. END
BEGIN NOW He knows. END
BEGIN NOW Rattle his bones. END
BEGIN NOW That afternoon of the inquest. END
BEGIN NOW The redlabelled bottle on the table. END
BEGIN NOW The
room in the hotel with hunting pictures. END
BEGIN NOW Stuffy it was. END
BEGIN NOW Sunlight through
the slats of the Venetian blind. END
BEGIN NOW The coroner's sunlit ears, big and hairy. END
BEGIN NOW Boots giving evidence. END
BEGIN NOW Thought he was asleep first. END
BEGIN NOW Then saw like yellow
streaks on his face. END
BEGIN NOW Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Verdict:
overdose. END
BEGIN NOW Death by misadventure. END
BEGIN NOW The letter. END
BEGIN NOW For my son Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW No more pain. END
BEGIN NOW Wake no more. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody owns. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. END
BEGIN NOW Over the stones. END
BEGIN NOW --We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW --God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW --I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW That will be a great race tomorrow
in Germany. END
BEGIN NOW The Gordon Bennett. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW That will be worth seeing, faith. END
BEGIN NOW As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent
over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. END
BEGIN NOW Has anybody
here seen Kelly? END
BEGIN NOW Kay ee double ell wy. END
BEGIN NOW Dead March from SAUL. END
BEGIN NOW He's as bad
as old Antonio. END
BEGIN NOW He left me on my ownio. END
BEGIN NOW Pirouette! END
BEGIN NOW The MATER
MISERICORDIAE. END
BEGIN NOW Eccles street. END
BEGIN NOW My house down there. END
BEGIN NOW Big place. END
BEGIN NOW Ward for
incurables there. END
BEGIN NOW Very encouraging. END
BEGIN NOW Our Lady's Hospice for the dying. END
BEGIN NOW Deadhouse handy underneath. END
BEGIN NOW Where old Mrs Riordan died. END
BEGIN NOW They look
terrible the women. END
BEGIN NOW Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the
spoon. END
BEGIN NOW Then the screen round her bed for her to die. END
BEGIN NOW Nice young student
that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. END
BEGIN NOW He's gone over to the lying-in
hospital they told me. END
BEGIN NOW From one extreme to the other. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage
galloped round a corner: stopped. END
BEGIN NOW --What's wrong now? END
BEGIN NOW A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing,
slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted
bony croups. END
BEGIN NOW Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating
their fear. END
BEGIN NOW --Emigrants, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW --Huuuh! END
BEGIN NOW the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks. END
BEGIN NOW Huuuh! END
BEGIN NOW out of that! END
BEGIN NOW Thursday, of course. END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow is killing day. END
BEGIN NOW Springers. END
BEGIN NOW Cuffe sold
them about twentyseven quid each. END
BEGIN NOW For Liverpool probably. END
BEGIN NOW Roastbeef for
old England. END
BEGIN NOW They buy up all the juicy ones. END
BEGIN NOW And then the fifth quarter
lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. END
BEGIN NOW Comes to a big thing in a
year. END
BEGIN NOW Dead meat trade. END
BEGIN NOW Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,
soap, margarine. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the
train at Clonsilla. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage moved on through the drove. END
BEGIN NOW --I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the
parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW All those animals could be taken in
trucks down to the boats. END
BEGIN NOW --Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Quite
right. END
BEGIN NOW They ought to. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have
municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. END
BEGIN NOW Run the line
out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and
all. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you see what I mean? END
BEGIN NOW --O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Pullman car and saloon
diningroom. END
BEGIN NOW --A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added. END
BEGIN NOW --Why? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't it be more
decent than galloping two abreast? END
BEGIN NOW --Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted. END
BEGIN NOW --And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when
the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road. END
BEGIN NOW --That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell
about the road. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible! END
BEGIN NOW --First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. END
BEGIN NOW Gordon Bennett cup. END
BEGIN NOW --Praises be to God! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said piously. END
BEGIN NOW Bom! END
BEGIN NOW Upset. END
BEGIN NOW A coffin bumped out on to the road. END
BEGIN NOW Burst open. END
BEGIN NOW Paddy
Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too
large for him. END
BEGIN NOW Red face: grey now. END
BEGIN NOW Mouth fallen open. END
BEGIN NOW Asking what's up
now. END
BEGIN NOW Quite right to close it. END
BEGIN NOW Looks horrid open. END
BEGIN NOW Then the insides
decompose quickly. END
BEGIN NOW Much better to close up all the orifices. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, also. END
BEGIN NOW With wax. END
BEGIN NOW The sphincter loose. END
BEGIN NOW Seal up all. END
BEGIN NOW --Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right. END
BEGIN NOW Dunphy's corner. END
BEGIN NOW Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. END
BEGIN NOW A pause by the wayside. END
BEGIN NOW Tiptop position for a pub. END
BEGIN NOW Expect we'll pull up
here on the way back to drink his health. END
BEGIN NOW Pass round the consolation. END
BEGIN NOW Elixir of life. END
BEGIN NOW But suppose now it did happen. END
BEGIN NOW Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in
the knocking about? END
BEGIN NOW He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Depends on
where. END
BEGIN NOW The circulation stops. END
BEGIN NOW Still some might ooze out of an artery. END
BEGIN NOW It
would be better to bury them in red: a dark red. END
BEGIN NOW In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. END
BEGIN NOW An empty hearse
trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved. END
BEGIN NOW Crossguns bridge: the royal canal. END
BEGIN NOW Water rushed roaring through the sluices. END
BEGIN NOW A man stood on his
dropping barge, between clamps of turf. END
BEGIN NOW On the towpath by the lock a
slacktethered horse. END
BEGIN NOW Aboard of the BUGABU. END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes watched him. END
BEGIN NOW On the slow weedy waterway he had floated
on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of
reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. END
BEGIN NOW Athlone, Mullingar,
Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. END
BEGIN NOW Or cycle
down. END
BEGIN NOW Hire some old crock, safety. END
BEGIN NOW Wren had one the other day at the
auction but a lady's. END
BEGIN NOW Developing waterways. END
BEGIN NOW James M'Cann's hobby to row
me o'er the ferry. END
BEGIN NOW Cheaper transit. END
BEGIN NOW By easy stages. END
BEGIN NOW Houseboats. END
BEGIN NOW Camping
out. END
BEGIN NOW Also hearses. END
BEGIN NOW To heaven by water. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps I will without writing. END
BEGIN NOW Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. END
BEGIN NOW Dropping down lock by lock to
Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW With turf from the midland bogs. END
BEGIN NOW Salute. END
BEGIN NOW He lifted his brown straw
hat, saluting Paddy Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. END
BEGIN NOW Near it now. END
BEGIN NOW --I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW --Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW --How is that? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Left him weeping, I suppose? END
BEGIN NOW --Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage steered left for Finglas road. END
BEGIN NOW The stonecutter's yard on the right. END
BEGIN NOW Last lap. END
BEGIN NOW Crowded on the spit of
land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,
knelt in grief, pointing. END
BEGIN NOW Fragments of shapes, hewn. END
BEGIN NOW In white silence:
appealing. END
BEGIN NOW The best obtainable. END
BEGIN NOW Thos. END
BEGIN NOW H. Dennany, monumental builder and
sculptor. END
BEGIN NOW Passed. END
BEGIN NOW On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat,
grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown
yawning boot. END
BEGIN NOW After life's journey. END
BEGIN NOW Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power pointed. END
BEGIN NOW --That is where Childs was murdered, he said. END
BEGIN NOW The last house. END
BEGIN NOW --So it is, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW A gruesome case. END
BEGIN NOW Seymour Bushe got him off. END
BEGIN NOW Murdered his brother. END
BEGIN NOW Or so they said. END
BEGIN NOW --The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW --Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. END
BEGIN NOW That's the maxim of
the law. END
BEGIN NOW Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent
person to be wrongfully condemned. END
BEGIN NOW They looked. END
BEGIN NOW Murderer's ground. END
BEGIN NOW It passed darkly. END
BEGIN NOW Shuttered,
tenantless, unweeded garden. END
BEGIN NOW Whole place gone to hell. END
BEGIN NOW Wrongfully
condemned. END
BEGIN NOW Murder. END
BEGIN NOW The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. END
BEGIN NOW They love reading about it. END
BEGIN NOW Man's head found in a garden. END
BEGIN NOW Her clothing
consisted of. END
BEGIN NOW How she met her death. END
BEGIN NOW Recent outrage. END
BEGIN NOW The weapon used. END
BEGIN NOW Murderer is still at large. END
BEGIN NOW Clues. END
BEGIN NOW A shoelace. END
BEGIN NOW The body to be exhumed. END
BEGIN NOW Murder will out. END
BEGIN NOW Cramped in this carriage. END
BEGIN NOW She mightn't like me to come that way
without letting her know. END
BEGIN NOW Must be careful about women. END
BEGIN NOW Catch them once
with their pants down. END
BEGIN NOW Never forgive you after. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen. END
BEGIN NOW The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. END
BEGIN NOW Dark poplars,
rare white forms. END
BEGIN NOW Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the
trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain
gestures on the air. END
BEGIN NOW The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. END
BEGIN NOW Martin
Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the
door open with his knee. END
BEGIN NOW He stepped out. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power and Mr Dedalus
followed. END
BEGIN NOW Change that soap now. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket
swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief
pocket. END
BEGIN NOW He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other
hand still held. END
BEGIN NOW Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. END
BEGIN NOW It's all the same. END
BEGIN NOW Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. END
BEGIN NOW Pomp of death. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. END
BEGIN NOW Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. END
BEGIN NOW Dogbiscuits. END
BEGIN NOW Who ate them? END
BEGIN NOW Mourners coming out. END
BEGIN NOW He followed his companions. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed,
Hynes walking after them. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and
took out the two wreaths. END
BEGIN NOW He handed one to the boy. END
BEGIN NOW Where is that child's funeral disappeared to? END
BEGIN NOW A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
granite block. END
BEGIN NOW The waggoner marching at their head saluted. END
BEGIN NOW Coffin now. END
BEGIN NOW Got here before us, dead as he is. END
BEGIN NOW Horse looking round at it
with his plume skeowways. END
BEGIN NOW Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on
a bloodvessel or something. END
BEGIN NOW Do they know what they cart out here every
day? END
BEGIN NOW Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. END
BEGIN NOW Then Mount Jerome for
the protestants. END
BEGIN NOW Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. END
BEGIN NOW Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. END
BEGIN NOW Thousands every hour. END
BEGIN NOW Too many in the world. END
BEGIN NOW Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. END
BEGIN NOW Leanjawed
harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. END
BEGIN NOW Girl's face stained with
dirt and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to
cry. END
BEGIN NOW Fish's face, bloodless and livid. END
BEGIN NOW The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. END
BEGIN NOW So
much dead weight. END
BEGIN NOW Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. END
BEGIN NOW First the
stiff: then the friends of the stiff. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher and the boy followed
with their wreaths. END
BEGIN NOW Who is that beside them? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, the brother-in-law. END
BEGIN NOW All walked after. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham whispered:

--I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW --What? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power whispered. END
BEGIN NOW How so? END
BEGIN NOW --His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. END
BEGIN NOW Had the
Queen's hotel in Ennis. END
BEGIN NOW You heard him say he was going to Clare. END
BEGIN NOW Anniversary. END
BEGIN NOW --O God! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power whispered. END
BEGIN NOW First I heard of it. END
BEGIN NOW Poisoned himself? END
BEGIN NOW He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes
followed towards the cardinal's mausoleum. END
BEGIN NOW Speaking. END
BEGIN NOW --Was he insured? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW --I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. END
BEGIN NOW But the policy was heavily mortgaged. END
BEGIN NOW Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane. END
BEGIN NOW --How many children did he leave? END
BEGIN NOW --Five. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's. END
BEGIN NOW --A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. END
BEGIN NOW Five young children. END
BEGIN NOW --A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added. END
BEGIN NOW --Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed. END
BEGIN NOW Has the laugh at him now. END
BEGIN NOW He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. END
BEGIN NOW She had
outlived him. END
BEGIN NOW Lost her husband. END
BEGIN NOW More dead for her than for me. END
BEGIN NOW One must
outlive the other. END
BEGIN NOW Wise men say. END
BEGIN NOW There are more women than men in the
world. END
BEGIN NOW Condole with her. END
BEGIN NOW Your terrible loss. END
BEGIN NOW I hope you'll soon follow
him. END
BEGIN NOW For Hindu widows only. END
BEGIN NOW She would marry another. END
BEGIN NOW Him? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Yet who
knows after. END
BEGIN NOW Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. END
BEGIN NOW Drawn on
a guncarriage. END
BEGIN NOW Victoria and Albert. END
BEGIN NOW Frogmore memorial mourning. END
BEGIN NOW But in
the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. END
BEGIN NOW Vain in her heart of hearts. END
BEGIN NOW All for a shadow. END
BEGIN NOW Consort not even a king. END
BEGIN NOW Her son was the substance. END
BEGIN NOW Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. END
BEGIN NOW It
never comes. END
BEGIN NOW One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more
in her warm bed. END
BEGIN NOW --How are you, Simon? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. END
BEGIN NOW Haven't
seen you for a month of Sundays. END
BEGIN NOW --Never better. END
BEGIN NOW How are all in Cork's own town? END
BEGIN NOW --I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned
Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW Same old six and eightpence. END
BEGIN NOW Stopped with Dick Tivy. END
BEGIN NOW --And how is Dick, the solid man? END
BEGIN NOW --Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered. END
BEGIN NOW --By the holy Paul! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. END
BEGIN NOW Dick Tivy bald? END
BEGIN NOW --Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
pointing ahead. END
BEGIN NOW A few bob a skull. END
BEGIN NOW Just to keep them going till the
insurance is cleared up. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. END
BEGIN NOW Is that the eldest boy in front? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton is
behind. END
BEGIN NOW He put down his name for a quid. END
BEGIN NOW --I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW I often told poor Paddy he ought
to mind that job. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry is not the worst in the world. END
BEGIN NOW --How did he lose it? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert asked. END
BEGIN NOW Liquor, what? END
BEGIN NOW --Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood
behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and
at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. END
BEGIN NOW Poor boy! END
BEGIN NOW Was he
there when the father? END
BEGIN NOW Both unconscious. END
BEGIN NOW Lighten up at the last moment
and recognise for the last time. END
BEGIN NOW All he might have done. END
BEGIN NOW I owe three
shillings to O'Grady. END
BEGIN NOW Would he understand? END
BEGIN NOW The mutes bore the coffin into
the chapel. END
BEGIN NOW Which end is his head? END
BEGIN NOW After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
light. END
BEGIN NOW The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
candles at its corners. END
BEGIN NOW Always in front of us. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher, laying a
wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. END
BEGIN NOW The mourners
knelt here and there in prayingdesks. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood behind near the font
and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his
pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. END
BEGIN NOW He fitted his black hat gently on
his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously. END
BEGIN NOW A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through
a door. END
BEGIN NOW The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one
hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly. END
BEGIN NOW Who'll read the book? END
BEGIN NOW I, said the rook. END
BEGIN NOW They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
with a fluent croak. END
BEGIN NOW Father Coffey. END
BEGIN NOW I knew his name was like a coffin. END
BEGIN NOW DOMINE-NAMINE. END
BEGIN NOW Bully about the muzzle he looks. END
BEGIN NOW Bosses the show. END
BEGIN NOW Muscular christian. END
BEGIN NOW Woe
betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. END
BEGIN NOW Thou art Peter. END
BEGIN NOW Burst
sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. END
BEGIN NOW With a belly on him
like a poisoned pup. END
BEGIN NOW Most amusing expressions that man finds. END
BEGIN NOW Hhhn: burst
sideways. END
BEGIN NOW --NON INTRES IN JUDICIUM CUM SERVO TUO, DOMINE. END
BEGIN NOW Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. END
BEGIN NOW Requiem
mass. END
BEGIN NOW Crape weepers. END
BEGIN NOW Blackedged notepaper. END
BEGIN NOW Your name on the altarlist. END
BEGIN NOW Chilly place this. END
BEGIN NOW Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in
the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes of a toad
too. END
BEGIN NOW What swells him up that way? END
BEGIN NOW Molly gets swelled after cabbage. END
BEGIN NOW Air of
the place maybe. END
BEGIN NOW Looks full up of bad gas. END
BEGIN NOW Must be an infernal lot of bad
gas round the place. END
BEGIN NOW Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. END
BEGIN NOW Who was telling me? END
BEGIN NOW Mervyn Browne. END
BEGIN NOW Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh's
lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins
sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. END
BEGIN NOW Out it rushes: blue. END
BEGIN NOW One
whiff of that and you're a doner. END
BEGIN NOW My kneecap is hurting me. END
BEGIN NOW Ow. END
BEGIN NOW That's better. END
BEGIN NOW The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's
bucket and shook it over the coffin. END
BEGIN NOW Then he walked to the other end and
shook it again. END
BEGIN NOW Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. END
BEGIN NOW As you
were before you rested. END
BEGIN NOW It's all written down: he has to do it. END
BEGIN NOW --ET NE NOS INDUCAS IN TENTATIONEM. END
BEGIN NOW The server piped the answers in the treble. END
BEGIN NOW I often thought it would be
better to have boy servants. END
BEGIN NOW Up to fifteen or so. END
BEGIN NOW After that, of
course ...

Holy water that was, I expect. END
BEGIN NOW Shaking sleep out of it. END
BEGIN NOW He must be fed
up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. END
BEGIN NOW What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. END
BEGIN NOW Every mortal day a
fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
with little sparrows' breasts. END
BEGIN NOW All the year round he prayed the same thing
over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. END
BEGIN NOW On Dignam now. END
BEGIN NOW --IN PARADISUM. END
BEGIN NOW Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. END
BEGIN NOW Says that over everybody. END
BEGIN NOW Tiresome kind of a job. END
BEGIN NOW But he has to say something. END
BEGIN NOW The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted
the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. END
BEGIN NOW Corny
Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. END
BEGIN NOW All
followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom came
last folding his paper again into his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW He gazed gravely at the
ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. END
BEGIN NOW The metal wheels
ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots
followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres. END
BEGIN NOW The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. END
BEGIN NOW Lord, I mustn't lilt here. END
BEGIN NOW --The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone. END
BEGIN NOW --He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. END
BEGIN NOW But his
heart is buried in Rome. END
BEGIN NOW How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! END
BEGIN NOW --Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW I'll soon be stretched
beside her. END
BEGIN NOW Let Him take me whenever He likes. END
BEGIN NOW Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power took his arm. END
BEGIN NOW --She's better where she is, he said kindly. END
BEGIN NOW --I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose she is in
heaven if there is a heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
plod by. END
BEGIN NOW --Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head. END
BEGIN NOW --The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose we can
do so too. END
BEGIN NOW We are the last. END
BEGIN NOW This cemetery is a treacherous place. END
BEGIN NOW They covered their heads. END
BEGIN NOW --The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan said with reproof. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Secret
eyes, secretsearching. END
BEGIN NOW Mason, I think: not sure. END
BEGIN NOW Beside him again. END
BEGIN NOW We are
the last. END
BEGIN NOW In the same boat. END
BEGIN NOW Hope he'll say something else. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan added:

--The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more
impressive I must say. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. END
BEGIN NOW The language of course was another thing. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan said with solemnity:

--I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE. END
BEGIN NOW That touches a man's inmost heart. END
BEGIN NOW --It does, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
with his toes to the daisies? END
BEGIN NOW No touching that. END
BEGIN NOW Seat of the affections. END
BEGIN NOW Broken heart. END
BEGIN NOW A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
every day. END
BEGIN NOW One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of
them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. END
BEGIN NOW Old rusty pumps: damn the
thing else. END
BEGIN NOW The resurrection and the life. END
BEGIN NOW Once you are dead you are dead. END
BEGIN NOW That last day idea. END
BEGIN NOW Knocking them all up out of their graves. END
BEGIN NOW Come forth,
Lazarus! END
BEGIN NOW And he came fifth and lost the job. END
BEGIN NOW Get up! END
BEGIN NOW Last day! END
BEGIN NOW Then every
fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his
traps. END
BEGIN NOW Find damn all of himself that morning. END
BEGIN NOW Pennyweight of powder in
a skull. END
BEGIN NOW Twelve grammes one pennyweight. END
BEGIN NOW Troy measure. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side. END
BEGIN NOW --Everything went off A1, he said. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW He looked on them from his drawling eye. END
BEGIN NOW Policeman's shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW With
your tooraloom tooraloom. END
BEGIN NOW --As it should be, Mr Kernan said. END
BEGIN NOW --What? END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan assured him. END
BEGIN NOW --Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton asked. END
BEGIN NOW I
know his face. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert glanced back. END
BEGIN NOW --Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
soprano. END
BEGIN NOW She's his wife. END
BEGIN NOW --O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't seen her for some time. END
BEGIN NOW he was a finelooking woman. END
BEGIN NOW I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen
golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. END
BEGIN NOW And a good armful she
was. END
BEGIN NOW He looked behind through the others. END
BEGIN NOW --What is he? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW What does he do? END
BEGIN NOW Wasn't he in the stationery line? END
BEGIN NOW I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert smiled. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. END
BEGIN NOW A traveller for blottingpaper. END
BEGIN NOW --In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like
that for? END
BEGIN NOW She had plenty of game in her then. END
BEGIN NOW --Has still, Ned Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW He does some canvassing for ads. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead. END
BEGIN NOW The barrow turned into a side lane. END
BEGIN NOW A portly man, ambushed among
the grasses, raised his hat in homage. END
BEGIN NOW The gravediggers touched their
caps. END
BEGIN NOW --John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. END
BEGIN NOW He never forgets a friend. END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said:

--I am come to pay you another visit. END
BEGIN NOW --My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want your
custom at all. END
BEGIN NOW Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back. END
BEGIN NOW --Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe? END
BEGIN NOW --I did not, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. END
BEGIN NOW The
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in
a discreet tone to their vacant smiles. END
BEGIN NOW --They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. END
BEGIN NOW They asked for
Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. END
BEGIN NOW After traipsing
about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. END
BEGIN NOW One of the drunks spelt
out the name: Terence Mulcahy. END
BEGIN NOW The other drunk was blinking up at a statue
of Our Saviour the widow had got put up. END
BEGIN NOW The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. END
BEGIN NOW He
resumed:

--And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, NOT A BLOODY BIT LIKE THE
MAN, says he. END
BEGIN NOW THAT'S NOT MULCAHY, says he, WHOEVER DONE IT. END
BEGIN NOW Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting
the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked. END
BEGIN NOW --That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes. END
BEGIN NOW --I know, Hynes said. END
BEGIN NOW I know that. END
BEGIN NOW --To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW It's pure goodheartedness:
damn the thing else. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. END
BEGIN NOW All want to be on
good terms with him. END
BEGIN NOW Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. END
BEGIN NOW Keys:
like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. END
BEGIN NOW No passout checks. END
BEGIN NOW HABEAS
CORPUS. END
BEGIN NOW I must see about that ad after the funeral. END
BEGIN NOW Did I write
Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing
to Martha? END
BEGIN NOW Hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office. END
BEGIN NOW Be the better
of a shave. END
BEGIN NOW Grey sprouting beard. END
BEGIN NOW That's the first sign when the hairs
come out grey. END
BEGIN NOW And temper getting cross. END
BEGIN NOW Silver threads among the grey. END
BEGIN NOW Fancy being his wife. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl. END
BEGIN NOW Come out and live in the graveyard. END
BEGIN NOW Dangle that before her. END
BEGIN NOW It might
thrill her first. END
BEGIN NOW Courting death ... END
BEGIN NOW Shades of night hovering here with
all the dead stretched about. END
BEGIN NOW The shadows of the tombs when churchyards
yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used
to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big
giant in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW Will o' the wisp. END
BEGIN NOW Gas of graves. END
BEGIN NOW Want to keep her mind
off it to conceive at all. END
BEGIN NOW Women especially are so touchy. END
BEGIN NOW Tell her a
ghost story in bed to make her sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Have you ever seen a ghost? END
BEGIN NOW Well, I
have. END
BEGIN NOW It was a pitchdark night. END
BEGIN NOW The clock was on the stroke of twelve. END
BEGIN NOW Still they'd kiss all right if properly keyed up. END
BEGIN NOW Whores in Turkish
graveyards. END
BEGIN NOW Learn anything if taken young. END
BEGIN NOW You might pick up a young
widow here. END
BEGIN NOW Men like that. END
BEGIN NOW Love among the tombstones. END
BEGIN NOW Romeo. END
BEGIN NOW Spice of
pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW In the midst of death we are in life. END
BEGIN NOW Both ends meet. END
BEGIN NOW Tantalising for the poor dead. END
BEGIN NOW Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the
starving. END
BEGIN NOW Gnawing their vitals. END
BEGIN NOW Desire to grig people. END
BEGIN NOW Molly wanting to
do it at the window. END
BEGIN NOW Eight children he has anyway. END
BEGIN NOW He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
after field. END
BEGIN NOW Holy fields. END
BEGIN NOW More room if they buried them standing. END
BEGIN NOW Sitting
or kneeling you couldn't. END
BEGIN NOW Standing? END
BEGIN NOW His head might come up some day above
ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. END
BEGIN NOW All honeycombed the ground
must be: oblong cells. END
BEGIN NOW And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and
edgings. END
BEGIN NOW His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. END
BEGIN NOW Well, so it is. END
BEGIN NOW Ought to be flowers of sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies
growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. END
BEGIN NOW The Botanic Gardens
are just over there. END
BEGIN NOW It's the blood sinking in the earth gives new life. END
BEGIN NOW Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. END
BEGIN NOW Every man
his price. END
BEGIN NOW Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable
for fruit garden. END
BEGIN NOW A bargain. END
BEGIN NOW By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor
and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. END
BEGIN NOW With thanks. END
BEGIN NOW I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
nails. END
BEGIN NOW Charnelhouses. END
BEGIN NOW Dreadful. END
BEGIN NOW Turning green and pink decomposing. END
BEGIN NOW Rot
quick in damp earth. END
BEGIN NOW The lean old ones tougher. END
BEGIN NOW Then a kind of a tallowy
kind of a cheesy. END
BEGIN NOW Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of
them. END
BEGIN NOW Then dried up. END
BEGIN NOW Deathmoths. END
BEGIN NOW Of course the cells or whatever they are
go on living. END
BEGIN NOW Changing about. END
BEGIN NOW Live for ever practically. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing to feed
on feed on themselves. END
BEGIN NOW But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. END
BEGIN NOW Soil must be simply
swirling with them. END
BEGIN NOW Your head it simply swurls. END
BEGIN NOW Those pretty little
seaside gurls. END
BEGIN NOW He looks cheerful enough over it. END
BEGIN NOW Gives him a sense of
power seeing all the others go under first. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder how he looks at life. END
BEGIN NOW Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. END
BEGIN NOW The one about the
bulletin. END
BEGIN NOW Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. END
BEGIN NOW 11 p.m.
(closing time). END
BEGIN NOW Not arrived yet. END
BEGIN NOW Peter. END
BEGIN NOW The dead themselves the men
anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in
fashion. END
BEGIN NOW A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW Keep out
the damp. END
BEGIN NOW You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. END
BEGIN NOW Gravediggers
in HAMLET. END
BEGIN NOW Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. END
BEGIN NOW Daren't joke
about the dead for two years at least. END
BEGIN NOW DE MORTUIS NIL NISI PRIUS. END
BEGIN NOW Go out
of mourning first. END
BEGIN NOW Hard to imagine his funeral. END
BEGIN NOW Seems a sort of a joke. END
BEGIN NOW Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. END
BEGIN NOW Gives you second
wind. END
BEGIN NOW New lease of life. END
BEGIN NOW --How many have-you for tomorrow? END
BEGIN NOW the caretaker asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Two, Corny Kelleher said. END
BEGIN NOW Half ten and eleven. END
BEGIN NOW The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW The barrow had ceased to
trundle. END
BEGIN NOW The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping
with care round the graves. END
BEGIN NOW The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its
nose on the brink, looping the bands round it. END
BEGIN NOW Burying him. END
BEGIN NOW We come to bury Caesar. END
BEGIN NOW His ides of March or June. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't know who is here nor care. END
BEGIN NOW Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? END
BEGIN NOW Now who is he I'd like to know? END
BEGIN NOW Now I'd give a trifle to know who he is. END
BEGIN NOW Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. END
BEGIN NOW A fellow could live on his
lonesome all his life. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he could. END
BEGIN NOW Still he'd have to get someone to
sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. END
BEGIN NOW We all do. END
BEGIN NOW Only
man buries. END
BEGIN NOW No, ants too. END
BEGIN NOW First thing strikes anybody. END
BEGIN NOW Bury the dead. END
BEGIN NOW Say
Robinson Crusoe was true to life. END
BEGIN NOW Well then Friday buried him. END
BEGIN NOW Every
Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it. END
BEGIN NOW O, POOR ROBINSON CRUSOE! END
BEGIN NOW HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO SO? END
BEGIN NOW Poor Dignam! END
BEGIN NOW His last lie on the earth in his box. END
BEGIN NOW When you think of
them all it does seem a waste of wood. END
BEGIN NOW All gnawed through. END
BEGIN NOW They could
invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way. END
BEGIN NOW Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's. END
BEGIN NOW They're so
particular. END
BEGIN NOW Lay me in my native earth. END
BEGIN NOW Bit of clay from the holy land. END

it means. END

Irishman's house is his coffin. END

idea. END

heads. END
BEGIN NOW Twelve. END

BEGIN NOW Where the deuce did he pop out of? END
BEGIN NOW He wasn't in the
chapel, that I'll swear. END

BEGIN NOW I had
one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. END

once. END
BEGIN NOW Used to change three suits in the day. END

mine turned by Mesias. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END

BEGIN NOW Also poor papa went away. END
BEGIN NOW Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. END
BEGIN NOW Whisper. END
BEGIN NOW The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly
in the black open space. END

caretaker. END
BEGIN NOW Wellcut frockcoat. END

go next. END

they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other. END

BEGIN NOW Hoping you're well
and not in hell. END
BEGIN NOW Nice change of air. END
BEGIN NOW Out of the fryingpan of life into the

BEGIN NOW Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. END
BEGIN NOW Mamma,
poor mamma, and little Rudy. END
BEGIN NOW The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay
in on the coffin. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom turned away his face. END
BEGIN NOW And if he was alive all
the time? END
BEGIN NOW Whew! END
BEGIN NOW By jingo, that would be awful! END
BEGIN NOW No, no: he is dead, of
course. END
BEGIN NOW Of course he is dead. END
BEGIN NOW Monday he died. END
BEGIN NOW They ought to have
some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or
a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. END
BEGIN NOW Flag of
distress. END

themselves without show. END

figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves. END
BEGIN NOW Quietly, sure of
his ground, he traversed the dismal fields. END
BEGIN NOW Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, the names. END
BEGIN NOW But he
knows them all. END
BEGIN NOW No: coming to me. END
BEGIN NOW --I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. END
BEGIN NOW What is your
christian name? END
BEGIN NOW I'm not sure. END
BEGIN NOW --L, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW And you might put down M'Coy's name too. END
BEGIN NOW He asked me to. END
BEGIN NOW --Charley, Hynes said writing. END
BEGIN NOW I know. END
BEGIN NOW He was on the FREEMAN once. END
BEGIN NOW So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. END
BEGIN NOW Good idea a postmortem for doctors. END
BEGIN NOW Find out what they imagine they
know. END
BEGIN NOW He died of a Tuesday. END
BEGIN NOW Got the run. END
BEGIN NOW Levanted with the cash of a few
ads. END
BEGIN NOW Charley, you're my darling. END
BEGIN NOW That was why he asked me to. END
BEGIN NOW O well,
does no harm. END
BEGIN NOW I saw to that, M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, old chap: much obliged. END
BEGIN NOW Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing. END
BEGIN NOW --And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
over there in the ... END
BEGIN NOW He looked around. END
BEGIN NOW --Macintosh. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Where is he now? END
BEGIN NOW --M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know who he is. END
BEGIN NOW Is that
his name? END
BEGIN NOW He moved away, looking about him. END
BEGIN NOW --No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. END
BEGIN NOW I say, Hynes! END
BEGIN NOW Didn't hear. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Where has he disappeared to? END
BEGIN NOW Not a sign. END
BEGIN NOW Well of
all the. END
BEGIN NOW Has anybody here seen? END
BEGIN NOW Kay ee double ell. END
BEGIN NOW Become invisible. END
BEGIN NOW Good
Lord, what became of him? END
BEGIN NOW A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade. END
BEGIN NOW --O, excuse me! END
BEGIN NOW He stepped aside nimbly. END
BEGIN NOW Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. END
BEGIN NOW It rose. END
BEGIN NOW Nearly over. END
BEGIN NOW A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their
spades. END
BEGIN NOW All uncovered again for a few instants. END
BEGIN NOW The boy propped his wreath
against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. END
BEGIN NOW The gravediggers put
on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. END
BEGIN NOW Then
knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. END
BEGIN NOW One bent to pluck from the
haft a long tuft of grass. END
BEGIN NOW One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with
shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. END
BEGIN NOW Silently at the gravehead
another coiled the coffinband. END
BEGIN NOW His navelcord. END
BEGIN NOW The brother-in-law, turning
away, placed something in his free hand. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry, sir:
trouble. END
BEGIN NOW Headshake. END
BEGIN NOW I know that. END
BEGIN NOW For yourselves just. END
BEGIN NOW The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths,
staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb. END
BEGIN NOW --Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. END
BEGIN NOW We have time. END
BEGIN NOW --Let us, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW With awe Mr
Power's blank voice spoke:

--Some say he is not in that grave at all. END
BEGIN NOW That the coffin was filled
with stones. END
BEGIN NOW That one day he will come again. END
BEGIN NOW Hynes shook his head. END
BEGIN NOW --Parnell will never come again, he said. END
BEGIN NOW He's there, all that was mortal
of him. END
BEGIN NOW Peace to his ashes. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels,
crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast
eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. END
BEGIN NOW More sensible to spend the money on
some charity for the living. END
BEGIN NOW Pray for the repose of the soul of. END
BEGIN NOW Does
anybody really? END
BEGIN NOW Plant him and have done with him. END
BEGIN NOW Like down a coalshoot. END
BEGIN NOW Then lump them together to save time. END
BEGIN NOW All souls' day. END
BEGIN NOW Twentyseventh I'll
be at his grave. END
BEGIN NOW Ten shillings for the gardener. END
BEGIN NOW He keeps it free of
weeds. END
BEGIN NOW Old man himself. END
BEGIN NOW Bent down double with his shears clipping. END
BEGIN NOW Near
death's door. END
BEGIN NOW Who passed away. END
BEGIN NOW Who departed this life. END
BEGIN NOW As if they did it
of their own accord. END
BEGIN NOW Got the shove, all of them. END
BEGIN NOW Who kicked the bucket. END
BEGIN NOW More interesting if they told you what they were. END
BEGIN NOW So and So, wheelwright. END
BEGIN NOW I travelled for cork lino. END
BEGIN NOW I paid five shillings in the pound. END
BEGIN NOW Or a
woman's with her saucepan. END
BEGIN NOW I cooked good Irish stew. END
BEGIN NOW Eulogy in a country
churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas
Campbell. END
BEGIN NOW Entered into rest the protestants put it. END
BEGIN NOW Old Dr Murren's. END
BEGIN NOW The great physician called him home. END
BEGIN NOW Well it's God's acre for them. END
BEGIN NOW Nice country residence. END
BEGIN NOW Newly plastered and painted. END
BEGIN NOW Ideal spot to
have a quiet smoke and read the CHURCH TIMES. END
BEGIN NOW Marriage ads they never
try to beautify. END
BEGIN NOW Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. END
BEGIN NOW Better value that for the money. END
BEGIN NOW Still, the flowers are more poetical. END
BEGIN NOW The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. END
BEGIN NOW Expresses nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Immortelles. END
BEGIN NOW A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. END
BEGIN NOW Like stuffed. END
BEGIN NOW Like the
wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. END
BEGIN NOW Hoo! END
BEGIN NOW Not a budge out of him. END
BEGIN NOW Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. END
BEGIN NOW Dead animal even sadder. END
BEGIN NOW Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a
daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave. END
BEGIN NOW The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. END
BEGIN NOW Heart on his sleeve. END
BEGIN NOW Ought to be
sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland was
dedicated to it or whatever that. END
BEGIN NOW Seems anything but pleased. END
BEGIN NOW Why this
infliction? END
BEGIN NOW Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of
fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy. END
BEGIN NOW Apollo that was. END
BEGIN NOW How many! END
BEGIN NOW All these here once walked round Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Faithful departed. END
BEGIN NOW As you are now so once were we. END
BEGIN NOW Besides how could you remember everybody? END
BEGIN NOW Eyes, walk, voice. END
BEGIN NOW Well,
the voice, yes: gramophone. END
BEGIN NOW Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it
in the house. END
BEGIN NOW After dinner on a Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW Put on poor old greatgrandfather. END
BEGIN NOW Kraahraark! END
BEGIN NOW Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain

BEGIN NOW Remind you of the voice like the photograph
reminds you of the face. END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after
fifteen years, say. END
BEGIN NOW For instance who? END
BEGIN NOW For instance some fellow that died
when I was in Wisdom Hely's. END
BEGIN NOW Rtststr! END
BEGIN NOW A rattle of pebbles. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW He looked down intently into a stone crypt. END
BEGIN NOW Some animal. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW There he goes. END
BEGIN NOW An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the
pebbles. END
BEGIN NOW An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. END
BEGIN NOW The grey
alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. END
BEGIN NOW Good hidingplace for treasure. END
BEGIN NOW Who lives there? END
BEGIN NOW Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. END
BEGIN NOW Robert
Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? END
BEGIN NOW Making his rounds. END
BEGIN NOW Tail gone now. END
BEGIN NOW One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Pick the
bones clean no matter who it was. END
BEGIN NOW Ordinary meat for them. END
BEGIN NOW A corpse is
meat gone bad. END
BEGIN NOW Well and what's cheese? END
BEGIN NOW Corpse of milk. END
BEGIN NOW I read in that
VOYAGES IN CHINA that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Cremation better. END
BEGIN NOW Priests dead against it. END
BEGIN NOW Devilling for the other firm. END
BEGIN NOW Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. END
BEGIN NOW Time of the plague. END
BEGIN NOW Quicklime
feverpits to eat them. END
BEGIN NOW Lethal chamber. END

BEGIN NOW Eaten by birds. END
BEGIN NOW Earth, fire, water. END
BEGIN NOW Drowning they say is the pleasantest. END
BEGIN NOW See your whole life in a flash. END
BEGIN NOW But
being brought back to life no. END
BEGIN NOW Can't bury in the air however. END
BEGIN NOW Out of a
flying machine. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let
down. END
BEGIN NOW Underground communication. END
BEGIN NOW We learned that from them. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't be
surprised. END
BEGIN NOW Regular square feed for them. END
BEGIN NOW Flies come before he's well dead. END
BEGIN NOW Got wind of Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW They wouldn't care about the smell of it. END
BEGIN NOW Saltwhite
crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips. END
BEGIN NOW The gates glimmered in front: still open. END
BEGIN NOW Back to the world again. END
BEGIN NOW Enough of this place. END
BEGIN NOW Brings you a bit nearer every time. END
BEGIN NOW Last time I was
here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. END
BEGIN NOW Poor papa too. END
BEGIN NOW The love that kills. END
BEGIN NOW And
even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read
of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running
gravesores. END
BEGIN NOW Give you the creeps after a bit. END
BEGIN NOW I will appear to you after
death. END
BEGIN NOW You will see my ghost after death. END
BEGIN NOW My ghost will haunt you after
death. END
BEGIN NOW There is another world after death named hell. END
BEGIN NOW I do not like that
other world she wrote. END
BEGIN NOW No more do I. END
BEGIN NOW Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. END
BEGIN NOW Feel live warm beings near you. END
BEGIN NOW Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. END
BEGIN NOW They
are not going to get me this innings. END
BEGIN NOW Warm beds: warm fullblooded life. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely. END
BEGIN NOW Solicitor, I think. END
BEGIN NOW I know his face. END
BEGIN NOW Menton, John Henry, solicitor,
commissioner for oaths and affidavits. END

the Tantalus glasses. END
BEGIN NOW Heart of gold really. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Menton. END
BEGIN NOW Got his rag out
that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. END
BEGIN NOW Pure fluke
of mine: the bias. END
BEGIN NOW Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. END
BEGIN NOW Hate at first
sight. END
BEGIN NOW Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by. END
BEGIN NOW Got a dinge in the side of his hat. END
BEGIN NOW Carriage probably. END
BEGIN NOW --Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them. END
BEGIN NOW They stopped. END
BEGIN NOW --Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving. END
BEGIN NOW --There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton took
off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his
coatsleeve. END
BEGIN NOW He clapped the hat on his head again. END
BEGIN NOW --It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment. END
BEGIN NOW --Thank you, he said shortly. END
BEGIN NOW They walked on towards the gates. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew
behind a few paces so as not to overhear. END

BEGIN NOW Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without
his seeing it. END
BEGIN NOW Oyster eyes. END

    IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS

in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out
with a roll of papers under his cape, a king's courier. END

newspaper in four clean strokes. END

Red Murray touched Mr Bloom's arm with the shears and whispered:

and stepped off posthaste with a word:

--FREEMAN! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom said slowly:

--Well, he is one of our saviours also. END
BEGIN NOW A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he
passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage,
along the now reverberating boards. END

BEGIN NOW Thumping. END
BEGIN NOW Thumping. END

BEGIN NOW HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT


Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman's spare body, admiring a glossy crown. END
BEGIN NOW Strange he never saw his real country. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland my country. END
BEGIN NOW Member
for College green. END
BEGIN NOW He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was
worth. END
BEGIN NOW It's the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in
the official gazette. END

BEGIN NOW Cuprani too, printer. END
BEGIN NOW More Irish than the Irish. END
BEGIN NOW The machines clanked in threefour time. END
BEGIN NOW Thump, thump, thump. END
BEGIN NOW Now if he got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they'd
clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back. END
BEGIN NOW Monkeydoodle the whole thing. END
BEGIN NOW Want a cool head. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said. END
BEGIN NOW Soon be calling him my lord mayor. END
BEGIN NOW Long John is backing him, they say. END
BEGIN NOW The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the
sheet and made a sign to a typesetter. END
BEGIN NOW He handed the sheet silently over
the dirty glass screen. END
BEGIN NOW --Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood in his way. END
BEGIN NOW --If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,
pointing backward with his thumb. END
BEGIN NOW --Did you? END
BEGIN NOW Hynes asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Mm, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Look sharp and you'll catch him. END

Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti's desk. END

BEGIN NOW This ad, you see. END
BEGIN NOW Keyes, you remember? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded. END
BEGIN NOW --He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW The foreman moved his pencil towards it. END
BEGIN NOW --But wait, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He wants it changed. END
BEGIN NOW Keyes, you see. END
BEGIN NOW He wants
two keys at the top. END
BEGIN NOW Hell of a racket they make. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't hear it. END
BEGIN NOW Nannan. END
BEGIN NOW Iron nerves. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe he understands what I. END
BEGIN NOW The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow,
began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket. END
BEGIN NOW --Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top. END
BEGIN NOW Let him take that in first. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
foreman's sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. END
BEGIN NOW Clank it. END
BEGIN NOW Clank it. END
BEGIN NOW Miles of
it unreeled. END
BEGIN NOW What becomes of it after? END
BEGIN NOW O, wrap up meat, parcels: various
uses, thousand and one things. END
BEGIN NOW Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew
swiftly on the scarred woodwork. END
BEGIN NOW HOUSE OF KEY(E)S


--Like that, see. END
BEGIN NOW Two crossed keys here. END
BEGIN NOW A circle. END
BEGIN NOW Then here the name. END
BEGIN NOW Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. END
BEGIN NOW So on. END
BEGIN NOW Better not teach him his own business. END
BEGIN NOW --You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. END
BEGIN NOW Then round the top
in leaded: the house of keys. END
BEGIN NOW You see? END
BEGIN NOW Do you think that's a good idea? END
BEGIN NOW The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched
there quietly. END
BEGIN NOW --The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. END
BEGIN NOW You know, councillor,
the Manx parliament. END
BEGIN NOW Innuendo of home rule. END
BEGIN NOW Tourists, you know, from the
isle of Man. END
BEGIN NOW Catches the eye, you see. END
BEGIN NOW Can you do that? END

BEGIN NOW But
then if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. END
BEGIN NOW Better not. END
BEGIN NOW --We can do that, the foreman said. END
BEGIN NOW Have you the design? END
BEGIN NOW --I can get it, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW It was in a Kilkenny paper. END
BEGIN NOW He has a house
there too. END
BEGIN NOW I'll just run out and ask him. END
BEGIN NOW Well, you can do that and just a
little par calling attention. END
BEGIN NOW You know the usual. END
BEGIN NOW Highclass licensed
premises. END
BEGIN NOW Longfelt want. END
BEGIN NOW So on. END
BEGIN NOW The foreman thought for an instant. END
BEGIN NOW --We can do that, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Let him give us a three months' renewal. END
BEGIN NOW A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. END
BEGIN NOW He began to check it
silently. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching
the silent typesetters at their cases. END
BEGIN NOW ORTHOGRAPHICAL

BEGIN NOW Cemetery put in of course on
account of the symmetry. END
BEGIN NOW I should have said when he clapped on his topper. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW I ought
to have said something about an old hat or something. END
BEGIN NOW No. END

The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:

--Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Where's the archbishop's letter? END
BEGIN NOW It's to be repeated in the
TELEGRAPH. END
BEGIN NOW Where's what's his name? END
BEGIN NOW He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines. END

BEGIN NOW --Ay. END
BEGIN NOW Where's Monks? END
BEGIN NOW --Monks! END

BEGIN NOW And then the
lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher. END
BEGIN NOW And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the
dog kills the cat. END
BEGIN NOW Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well. END
BEGIN NOW Justice it means but it's everybody eating everyone else. END
BEGIN NOW That's what life
is after all. END
BEGIN NOW How quickly he does that job. END
BEGIN NOW Practice makes perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Seems
to see with his fingers. END

to the landing. END

him out perhaps. END

BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert it is. END
BEGIN NOW He entered softly. END
BEGIN NOW ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA


--The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to
the dusty windowpane. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert's
quizzing face, asked of it sourly:

--Agonising Christ, wouldn't it give you a heartburn on your arse? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:

--OR AGAIN, NOTE THE MEANDERINGS OF SOME PURLING RILL AS IT BABBLES ON

about that, Simon? END

BEGIN NOW How's that
for high? END
BEGIN NOW --Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:

--THE PENSIVE BOSOM AND THE OVERARSING LEAFAGE. END
BEGIN NOW O boys! END
BEGIN NOW O boys! END
BEGIN NOW --And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again
on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea. END
BEGIN NOW --That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want to
hear any more of the stuff. END
BEGIN NOW He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand. END
BEGIN NOW High falutin stuff. END
BEGIN NOW Bladderbags. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert is taking a day off I
see. END
BEGIN NOW Rather upsets a man's day, a funeral does. END
BEGIN NOW He has influence they say. END
BEGIN NOW Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his

BEGIN NOW --Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW --What is it? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW --A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered
with pomp of tone. END
BEGIN NOW OUR LOVELY LAND. END
BEGIN NOW SHORT BUT TO THE POINT


--Whose land? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom said simply. END
BEGIN NOW --Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. END
BEGIN NOW With an
accent on the whose. END
BEGIN NOW --Dan Dawson's land Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW --Is it his speech last night? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert nodded. END
BEGIN NOW --But listen to this, he said. END
BEGIN NOW The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was
pushed in. END
BEGIN NOW --Excuse me, J. J. O'Molloy said, entering. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside. END
BEGIN NOW --I beg yours, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --Good day, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW --Come in. END
BEGIN NOW Come in. END
BEGIN NOW --Good day. END
BEGIN NOW --How are you, Dedalus? END
BEGIN NOW --Well. END
BEGIN NOW And yourself? END

BEGIN NOW --You're looking extra. END
BEGIN NOW --Is the editor to be seen? END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy asked, looking towards the
inner door. END
BEGIN NOW --Very much so, professor MacHugh said. END
BEGIN NOW To be seen and heard. END
BEGIN NOW He's in
his sanctum with Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the
pink pages of the file. END

--Bombast! END
BEGIN NOW the professor broke in testily. END
BEGIN NOW Enough of the inflated
windbag! END
BEGIN NOW --PEAKS, Ned Lambert went on, TOWERING HIGH ON HIGH, TO BATHE OUR SOULS,
AS IT WERE ...

--Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. END

BEGIN NOW Yes? END
BEGIN NOW Is he
taking anything for it? END

--The moon, professor MacHugh said. END

BEGIN NOW --THAT MANTLES THE VISTA FAR AND WIDE AND WAIT TILL THE GLOWING ORB OF
THE MOON SHINE FORTH TO IRRADIATE HER SILVER EFFULGENCE ...

--O! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. END
BEGIN NOW Shite and onions! END
BEGIN NOW That'll do, Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Life is too short. END
BEGIN NOW He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy
moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. END
BEGIN NOW An
instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh's
unshaven blackspectacled face. END
BEGIN NOW --Doughy Daw! END
BEGIN NOW he cried. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT WETHERUP SAID


All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot
cake that stuff. END
BEGIN NOW He was in the bakery line too, wasn't he? END
BEGIN NOW Why they call
him Doughy Daw. END
BEGIN NOW Feathered his nest well anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW Daughter engaged to that
chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. END
BEGIN NOW Hooked that nicely. END
BEGIN NOW Entertainments. END
BEGIN NOW Open house. END
BEGIN NOW Big blowout. END
BEGIN NOW Wetherup always said that. END
BEGIN NOW Get
a grip of them by the stomach. END
BEGIN NOW The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face,
crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. END
BEGIN NOW The bold blue eyes
stared about them and the harsh voice asked:

--What is it? END
BEGIN NOW --And here comes the sham squire himself! END
BEGIN NOW professor MacHugh said grandly. END
BEGIN NOW --Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! END
BEGIN NOW the editor said in recognition. END
BEGIN NOW --Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. END
BEGIN NOW I must get a drink
after that. END
BEGIN NOW --Drink! END
BEGIN NOW the editor cried. END
BEGIN NOW No drinks served before mass. END
BEGIN NOW --Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. END
BEGIN NOW The editor's blue eyes roved
towards Mr Bloom's face, shadowed by a smile. END
BEGIN NOW --Will you join us, Myles? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert asked. END
BEGIN NOW MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED


--North Cork militia! END
BEGIN NOW the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. END
BEGIN NOW We
won every time! END
BEGIN NOW North Cork and Spanish officers! END
BEGIN NOW --Where was that, Myles? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at
his toecaps. END
BEGIN NOW --In Ohio! END
BEGIN NOW the editor shouted. END
BEGIN NOW --So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed. END
BEGIN NOW Passing out he whispered to J. J. O'Molloy:

--Incipient jigs. END
BEGIN NOW Sad case. END
BEGIN NOW --Ohio! END
BEGIN NOW the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face. END
BEGIN NOW My Ohio! END
BEGIN NOW --A perfect cretic! END
BEGIN NOW the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW Long, short and long. END
BEGIN NOW O, HARP EOLIAN! END
BEGIN NOW He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking
off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant
unwashed teeth. END
BEGIN NOW --Bingbang, bangbang. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door. END
BEGIN NOW --Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I just want to phone about an ad. END
BEGIN NOW He went in. END
BEGIN NOW --What about that leader this evening? END
BEGIN NOW professor MacHugh asked, coming
to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW --That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. END
BEGIN NOW Never you fret. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW That's all right. END
BEGIN NOW --Good day, Myles, J. J. O'Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
limply back on the file. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Canada swindle case on today? END
BEGIN NOW The telephone whirred inside. END
BEGIN NOW --Twentyeight ... No, twenty ... END
BEGIN NOW Double four ... END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW SPOT THE WINNER


Lenehan came out of the inner office with SPORT'S tissues. END
BEGIN NOW --Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Sceptre with O.
Madden up. END
BEGIN NOW He tossed the tissues on to the table. END
BEGIN NOW Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door
was flung open. END
BEGIN NOW --Hush, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW I hear feetstoops. END
BEGIN NOW Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing
urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
steps. END
BEGIN NOW The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air
blue scrawls and under the table came to earth. END
BEGIN NOW --It wasn't me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW It was the big fellow shoved me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. END
BEGIN NOW There's a hurricane
blowing. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he
stooped twice. END
BEGIN NOW --Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. END
BEGIN NOW It was Pat
Farrell shoved me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe. END
BEGIN NOW --Him, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly. END
BEGIN NOW He hustled the boy out and banged the door to. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:

--Continued on page six, column four. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, EVENING TELEGRAPH here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office. END
BEGIN NOW Is
the boss ...? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, TELEGRAPH ... To where? END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW Which auction rooms? END
BEGIN NOW ...
Aha! END
BEGIN NOW I see ... END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW I'll catch him. END
BEGIN NOW A COLLISION ENSUES


The bell whirred again as he rang off. END
BEGIN NOW He came in quickly and
bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue. END
BEGIN NOW --PARDON, MONSIEUR, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making
a grimace. END
BEGIN NOW --My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. END
BEGIN NOW Are you hurt? END
BEGIN NOW I'm in a
hurry. END
BEGIN NOW --Knee, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:

--The accumulation of the ANNO DOMINI. END
BEGIN NOW --Sorry, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy
slapped the heavy pages over. END
BEGIN NOW The noise of two shrill voices, a
mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the
doorsteps:


  --WE ARE THE BOYS OF WEXFORD
    WHO FOUGHT WITH HEART AND HAND. END
BEGIN NOW EXIT BLOOM


--I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad
of Keyes's. END
BEGIN NOW Want to fix it up. END
BEGIN NOW They tell me he's round there in Dillon's. END
BEGIN NOW He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. END
BEGIN NOW The editor who,
leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,
suddenly stretched forth an arm amply. END
BEGIN NOW --Begone! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW The world is before you. END
BEGIN NOW --Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan's hand and read them,
blowing them apart gently, without comment. END
BEGIN NOW --He'll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the young scamps after
him. END
BEGIN NOW --Show. END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan cried, running to the window. END
BEGIN NOW A STREET CORTEGE


Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
Bloom's wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
tail of white bowknots. END
BEGIN NOW --Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and
you'll kick. END
BEGIN NOW O, my rib risible! END
BEGIN NOW Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk. END
BEGIN NOW Small nines. END
BEGIN NOW Steal upon larks. END
BEGIN NOW He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding
feet past the fireplace to J. J. O'Molloy who placed the tissues in his
receiving hands. END
BEGIN NOW --What's that? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said with a start. END
BEGIN NOW Where are the other two
gone? END
BEGIN NOW --Who? END
BEGIN NOW the professor said, turning. END
BEGIN NOW They're gone round to the Oval for a
drink. END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. END
BEGIN NOW Came over last night. END
BEGIN NOW --Come on then, Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW Where's my hat? END
BEGIN NOW He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket,
jingling his keys in his back pocket. END
BEGIN NOW They jingled then in the air and
against the wood as he locked his desk drawer. END
BEGIN NOW --He's pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice. END
BEGIN NOW --Seems to be, J. J. O'Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. END
BEGIN NOW Who has the most
matches? END
BEGIN NOW THE CALUMET OF PEACE


He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. END
BEGIN NOW J. J.
O'Molloy opened his case again and offered it. END
BEGIN NOW --THANKY VOUS, Lenehan said, helping himself. END
BEGIN NOW The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. END
BEGIN NOW He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:


  --'TWAS RANK AND FAME THAT TEMPTED THEE,
    'TWAS EMPIRE CHARMED THY HEART. END
BEGIN NOW The professor grinned, locking his long lips. END
BEGIN NOW --Eh? END
BEGIN NOW You bloody old Roman empire? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW He took a cigarette from the open case. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan, lighting it for him
with quick grace, said:

--Silence for my brandnew riddle! END
BEGIN NOW --IMPERIUM ROMANUM, J. J. O'Molloy said gently. END
BEGIN NOW It sounds nobler than
British or Brixton. END
BEGIN NOW The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire. END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW --That's it, he said. END
BEGIN NOW We are the fat. END
BEGIN NOW You and I are the fat in the fire. END
BEGIN NOW We haven't got the chance of a snowball in hell. END
BEGIN NOW THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME


--Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. END
BEGIN NOW We
mustn't be led away by words, by sounds of words. END
BEGIN NOW We think of Rome,
imperial, imperious, imperative. END
BEGIN NOW He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:

--What was their civilisation? END
BEGIN NOW Vast, I allow: but vile. END
BEGIN NOW Cloacae: sewers. END
BEGIN NOW The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: IT IS MEET TO BE
HERE. END
BEGIN NOW LET US BUILD AN ALTAR TO JEHOVAH. END
BEGIN NOW The Roman, like the Englishman who
follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his
foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. END
BEGIN NOW He gazed
about him in his toga and he said: IT IS MEET TO BE HERE. END
BEGIN NOW LET US CONSTRUCT
A WATERCLOSET. END
BEGIN NOW --Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW Our old ancient ancestors,
as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial to the running
stream. END
BEGIN NOW --They were nature's gentlemen, J. J. O'Molloy murmured. END
BEGIN NOW But we have
also Roman law. END
BEGIN NOW --And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy asked. END
BEGIN NOW It was at the royal university dinner. END
BEGIN NOW Everything was going
swimmingly ...

--First my riddle, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW Are you ready? END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in
from the hallway. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered. END
BEGIN NOW --ENTREZ, MES ENFANTS! END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan cried. END
BEGIN NOW --I escort a suppliant, Mr O'Madden Burke said melodiously. END
BEGIN NOW Youth led by
Experience visits Notoriety. END
BEGIN NOW --How do you do? END
BEGIN NOW the editor said, holding out a hand. END
BEGIN NOW Come in. END
BEGIN NOW Your
governor is just gone. END
BEGIN NOW ? END
BEGIN NOW ? END
BEGIN NOW ? END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan said to all:

--Silence! END
BEGIN NOW What opera resembles a railwayline? END
BEGIN NOW Reflect, ponder,
excogitate, reply. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature. END
BEGIN NOW --Who? END
BEGIN NOW the editor asked. END
BEGIN NOW Bit torn off. END
BEGIN NOW --Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW --That old pelters, the editor said. END
BEGIN NOW Who tore it? END
BEGIN NOW Was he short taken? END
BEGIN NOW ON SWIFT SAIL FLAMING
    FROM STORM AND SOUTH
    HE COMES, PALE VAMPIRE,
    MOUTH TO MY MOUTH. END
BEGIN NOW --Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their
shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Foot and mouth? END
BEGIN NOW Are you turned ...? END
BEGIN NOW Bullockbefriending bard. END
BEGIN NOW SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT


--Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. END
BEGIN NOW The letter is not mine. END
BEGIN NOW Mr
Garrett Deasy asked me to ...

--O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. END
BEGIN NOW The
bloodiest old tartar God ever made. END
BEGIN NOW By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth
disease and no mistake! END
BEGIN NOW The night she threw the soup in the waiter's face
in the Star and Garter. END
BEGIN NOW Oho! END
BEGIN NOW A woman brought sin into the world. END
BEGIN NOW For Helen, the runaway wife of
Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. END
BEGIN NOW O'Rourke, prince of Breffni. END
BEGIN NOW --Is he a widower? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the
typescript. END
BEGIN NOW Emperor's horses. END
BEGIN NOW Habsburg. END
BEGIN NOW An Irishman saved his life on the
ramparts of Vienna. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you forget! END
BEGIN NOW Maximilian Karl O'Donnell, graf
von Tirconnell in Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian
fieldmarshal now. END
BEGIN NOW Going to be trouble there one day. END
BEGIN NOW Wild geese. END
BEGIN NOW O yes,
every time. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you forget that! END
BEGIN NOW --The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O'Molloy said quietly,
turning a horseshoe paperweight. END
BEGIN NOW Saving princes is a thank you job. END
BEGIN NOW Professor MacHugh turned on him. END
BEGIN NOW --And if not? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW --I'll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. END
BEGIN NOW A Hungarian it was one
day ...


    LOST CAUSES


    NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED


--We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW Success for us
is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. END
BEGIN NOW We were never loyal
to the successful. END
BEGIN NOW We serve them. END
BEGIN NOW I teach the blatant Latin language. END
BEGIN NOW I

is money. END

by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece. END

BEGIN NOW Lenehan wept with a little noise. END
BEGIN NOW Owing to a brick received in

BEGIN NOW Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! END

BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket. END
BEGIN NOW --That'll be all right, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I'll read the rest after. END
BEGIN NOW That'll be all
right. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan extended his hands in protest. END
BEGIN NOW --But my riddle! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW What opera is like a railwayline? END
BEGIN NOW --Opera? END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Madden Burke's sphinx face reriddled. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan announced gladly:


--THE ROSE OF CASTILE. END
BEGIN NOW See the wheeze? END

BEGIN NOW Gee! END
BEGIN NOW He poked Mr O'Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Madden Burke
fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp. END
BEGIN NOW --Help! END
BEGIN NOW he sighed. END
BEGIN NOW I feel a strong weakness. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
tissues. END
BEGIN NOW The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
Stephen's and Mr O'Madden Burke's loose ties. END
BEGIN NOW --Paris, past and present, he said. END

--The turf, Lenehan put in. END
BEGIN NOW --Literature, the press. END
BEGIN NOW --If Bloom were here, the professor said. END

BEGIN NOW --And Madam Bloom, Mr O'Madden Burke added. END

BEGIN NOW O, for a fresh of breath air! END
BEGIN NOW I caught a
cold in the park. END
BEGIN NOW The gate was open. END
BEGIN NOW YOU CAN DO IT! END
BEGIN NOW The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen's shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW --I want you to write something for me, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Something with a bite in
it. END
BEGIN NOW You can do it. END
BEGIN NOW I see it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW IN THE LEXICON OF YOUTH ...

See it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW See it in your eye. END
BEGIN NOW Lazy idle little schemer. END

BEGIN NOW Wait a minute. END
BEGIN NOW We'll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when
he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. END
BEGIN NOW Gallaher,
that was a pressman for you. END
BEGIN NOW That was a pen. END
BEGIN NOW You know how he made his
mark? END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you. END
BEGIN NOW That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known. END
BEGIN NOW That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in
the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW I'll show you. END
BEGIN NOW He pushed past them to the files. END
BEGIN NOW --Look at here, he said turning. END
BEGIN NOW The NEW YORK WORLD cabled for a special. END
BEGIN NOW Remember that time? END
BEGIN NOW Professor MacHugh nodded. END
BEGIN NOW --NEW YORK WORLD, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat. END
BEGIN NOW Where it took place. END
BEGIN NOW Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. END
BEGIN NOW Joe Brady and the
rest of them. END
BEGIN NOW Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. END
BEGIN NOW Whole route, see? END
BEGIN NOW --Skin-the-Goat, Mr O'Madden Burke said. END
BEGIN NOW Fitzharris. END
BEGIN NOW He has that
cabman's shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Holohan told me. END
BEGIN NOW You know Holohan? END
BEGIN NOW --Hop and carry one, is it? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW --And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for
the corporation. END
BEGIN NOW A night watchman. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen turned in surprise. END
BEGIN NOW --Gumley? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW You don't say so? END
BEGIN NOW A friend of my father's, is it? END
BEGIN NOW --Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. END
BEGIN NOW Let Gumley mind
the stones, see they don't run away. END
BEGIN NOW Look at here. END
BEGIN NOW What did Ignatius
Gallaher do? END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Inspiration of genius. END
BEGIN NOW Cabled right away. END
BEGIN NOW Have
you WEEKLY FREEMAN of 17 March? END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW Have you got that? END
BEGIN NOW He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point. END
BEGIN NOW --Take page four, advertisement for Bransome's coffee, let us say. END
BEGIN NOW Have
you got that? END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW The telephone whirred. END
BEGIN NOW A DISTANT VOICE


--I'll answer it, the professor said, going. END
BEGIN NOW --B is parkgate. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating. END
BEGIN NOW --T is viceregal lodge. END
BEGIN NOW C is where murder took place. END
BEGIN NOW K is Knockmaroon

BEGIN NOW The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock's wattles. END
BEGIN NOW An illstarched
dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his
waistcoat. END

BEGIN NOW Hello?... END
BEGIN NOW Who's there? END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW Yes ... END
BEGIN NOW Yes ... END

BEGIN NOW F.A.B.P. END
BEGIN NOW Got that? END
BEGIN NOW X is Davy's publichouse in upper Leeson street. END
BEGIN NOW The professor came to the inner door. END
BEGIN NOW --Bloom is at the telephone, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. END
BEGIN NOW X is Davy's publichouse,
see? END
BEGIN NOW CLEVER, VERY


--Clever, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW Very. END
BEGIN NOW --Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody
history. END
BEGIN NOW Nightmare from which you will never awake. END
BEGIN NOW --I saw it, the editor said proudly. END
BEGIN NOW I was present. END
BEGIN NOW Dick Adams, the
besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and
myself. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:

--Madam, I'm Adam. END
BEGIN NOW And Able was I ere I saw Elba. END
BEGIN NOW --History! END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford cried. END
BEGIN NOW The Old Woman of Prince's street was
there first. END
BEGIN NOW There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. END
BEGIN NOW Out of an
advertisement. END
BEGIN NOW Gregor Grey made the design for it. END
BEGIN NOW That gave him the leg
up. END
BEGIN NOW Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the STAR. END
BEGIN NOW Now he's got in with Blumenfeld. END
BEGIN NOW That's press. END
BEGIN NOW That's talent. END
BEGIN NOW Pyatt! END
BEGIN NOW He
was all their daddies! END
BEGIN NOW --The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the
brother-in-law of Chris Callinan. END
BEGIN NOW --Hello? END
BEGIN NOW ... Are you there? END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he's here still. END
BEGIN NOW Come across
yourself. END
BEGIN NOW --Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? END
BEGIN NOW the editor cried. END
BEGIN NOW He flung the pages down. END
BEGIN NOW --Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O'Madden Burke. END
BEGIN NOW --Very smart, Mr O'Madden Burke said. END
BEGIN NOW Professor MacHugh came from the inner office. END
BEGIN NOW --Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers
were up before the recorder ...

--O yes, J. J. O'Molloy said eagerly. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Dudley was walking home
through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone
last year and thought she'd buy a view of Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW And it turned out to be
a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat. END
BEGIN NOW Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! END
BEGIN NOW --They're only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW Psha! END
BEGIN NOW Press and the bar! END
BEGIN NOW Where have you a man now at the bar like those
fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O'Hagan. END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, bloody nonsense. END
BEGIN NOW Psha! END
BEGIN NOW Only in the halfpenny place. END
BEGIN NOW His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain. END
BEGIN NOW Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? END
BEGIN NOW How do you know? END
BEGIN NOW Why did
you write it then? END

construction on my words. END

face. END

BEGIN NOW Where are you now? END
BEGIN NOW Established 1763. END
BEGIN NOW Dr Lucas. END
BEGIN NOW Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? END
BEGIN NOW Psha! END
BEGIN NOW --Well, J. J. O'Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example. END
BEGIN NOW --Bushe? END
BEGIN NOW the editor said. END
BEGIN NOW Well, yes: Bushe, yes. END
BEGIN NOW He has a strain of it in
his blood. END
BEGIN NOW Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe. END
BEGIN NOW --He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only
for ... END
BEGIN NOW But no matter. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:

--One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life
fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. END
BEGIN NOW It was in that case of fratricide,
the Childs murder case. END
BEGIN NOW Bushe defended him. END
BEGIN NOW AND IN THE PORCHES OF MINE EAR DID POUR. END
BEGIN NOW By the way how did he find that out? END
BEGIN NOW He died in his sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Or the
other story, beast with two backs? END
BEGIN NOW --What was that? END
BEGIN NOW the professor asked. END
BEGIN NOW ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM


--He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O'Molloy said, of Roman justice
as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the LEX TALIONIS. END
BEGIN NOW And he cited
the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican. END
BEGIN NOW --Ha. END
BEGIN NOW --A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. END
BEGIN NOW Silence! END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy took out his cigarettecase. END
BEGIN NOW False lull. END
BEGIN NOW Something quite ordinary. END
BEGIN NOW Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar. END
BEGIN NOW I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that
it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,
that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. END
BEGIN NOW A POLISHED PERIOD


J. J. O'Molloy resumed, moulding his words:

--He said of it: THAT STONY EFFIGY IN FROZEN MUSIC, HORNED AND TERRIBLE,
OF THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE, THAT ETERNAL SYMBOL OF WISDOM AND OF PROPHECY
WHICH, IF AUGHT THAT THE IMAGINATION OR THE HAND OF SCULPTOR HAS WROUGHT
IN MARBLE OF SOULTRANSFIGURED AND OF SOULTRANSFIGURING DESERVES TO LIVE,
DESERVES TO LIVE. END
BEGIN NOW His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall. END
BEGIN NOW --Fine! END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said at once. END
BEGIN NOW --The divine afflatus, Mr O'Madden Burke said. END
BEGIN NOW --You like it? END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy asked Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. END
BEGIN NOW He took a cigarette from the case. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy offered his case to
Myles Crawford. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his
trophy, saying:

--Muchibus thankibus. END
BEGIN NOW A MAN OF HIGH MORALE


--Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O'Molloy said to
Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush
poets: A. E. the mastermystic? END
BEGIN NOW That Blavatsky woman started it. END
BEGIN NOW She was a
nice old bag of tricks. END
BEGIN NOW A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer
that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about
planes of consciousness. END
BEGIN NOW Magennis thinks you must have been pulling
A. E.'s leg. END
BEGIN NOW He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis. END
BEGIN NOW Speaking about me. END
BEGIN NOW What did he say? END
BEGIN NOW What did he say? END
BEGIN NOW What did he
say about me? END
BEGIN NOW Don't ask. END
BEGIN NOW --No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside. END
BEGIN NOW Wait a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Let me say one thing. END
BEGIN NOW The finest display of oratory I ever
heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
society. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
advocating the revival of the Irish tongue. END
BEGIN NOW He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:

--You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. END
BEGIN NOW Then you can imagine the style of his
discourse. END
BEGIN NOW --He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O'Molloy said, rumour has it, on
the Trinity college estates commission. END
BEGIN NOW --He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child's
frock. END
BEGIN NOW Go on. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW --It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,
full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not
say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man's contumely upon the
new movement. END
BEGIN NOW It was then a new movement. END
BEGIN NOW We were weak, therefore
worthless. END
BEGIN NOW He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus. END
BEGIN NOW IMPROMPTU


In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O'Molloy:

--Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. END
BEGIN NOW That he had
prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one
shorthandwriter in the hall. END
BEGIN NOW His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy
beard round it. END
BEGIN NOW He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he
looked (though he was not) a dying man. END
BEGIN NOW His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O'Molloy's towards
Stephen's face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. END
BEGIN NOW His unglazed
linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair. END
BEGIN NOW Still seeking, he said:

--When Fitzgibbon's speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply. END
BEGIN NOW Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these. END
BEGIN NOW He raised his head firmly. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes bethought themselves once more. END
BEGIN NOW Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet. END
BEGIN NOW He began:

--MR CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: GREAT WAS MY ADMIRATION IN LISTENING
TO THE REMARKS ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTH OF IRELAND A MOMENT SINCE BY MY
LEARNED FRIEND. END
BEGIN NOW IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED INTO A COUNTRY
FAR AWAY FROM THIS COUNTRY, INTO AN AGE REMOTE FROM THIS AGE, THAT I STOOD
IN ANCIENT EGYPT AND THAT I WAS LISTENING TO THE SPEECH OF SOME HIGHPRIEST
OF THAT LAND ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTHFUL MOSES. END
BEGIN NOW His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes
ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. END
BEGIN NOW And let our
crooked smokes. END
BEGIN NOW Noble words coming. END
BEGIN NOW Look out. END
BEGIN NOW Could you try your hand at
it yourself? END
BEGIN NOW --AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HEARD THE VOICE OF THAT EGYPTIAN HIGHPRIEST
RAISED IN A TONE OF LIKE HAUGHTINESS AND LIKE PRIDE. END
BEGIN NOW I HEARD HIS WORDS AND
THEIR MEANING WAS REVEALED TO ME. END
BEGIN NOW FROM THE FATHERS


It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are
corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were
good could be corrupted. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, curse you! END
BEGIN NOW That's saint Augustine. END
BEGIN NOW --WHY WILL YOU JEWS NOT ACCEPT OUR CULTURE, OUR RELIGION AND OUR
LANGUAGE? END
BEGIN NOW YOU ARE A TRIBE OF NOMAD HERDSMEN: WE ARE A MIGHTY PEOPLE. END
BEGIN NOW YOU
HAVE NO CITIES NOR NO WEALTH: OUR CITIES ARE HIVES OF HUMANITY AND OUR
GALLEYS, TRIREME AND  QUADRIREME, LADEN WITH ALL MANNER MERCHANDISE FURROW
THE WATERS OF THE KNOWN GLOBE. END
BEGIN NOW YOU HAVE BUT EMERGED FROM PRIMITIVE
CONDITIONS: WE HAVE A LITERATURE, A PRIESTHOOD, AN AGELONG HISTORY AND A
POLITY. END
BEGIN NOW Nile. END
BEGIN NOW Child, man, effigy. END
BEGIN NOW By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man
supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone. END
BEGIN NOW --YOU PRAY TO A LOCAL AND OBSCURE IDOL: OUR TEMPLES, MAJESTIC AND
MYSTERIOUS, ARE THE ABODES OF ISIS AND OSIRIS, OF HORUS AND AMMON RA. END
BEGIN NOW YOURS SERFDOM, AWE AND HUMBLENESS: OURS THUNDER AND THE SEAS. END
BEGIN NOW ISRAEL IS
WEAK AND FEW ARE HER CHILDREN: EGYPT IS AN HOST AND TERRIBLE ARE HER ARMS. END
BEGIN NOW VAGRANTS AND DAYLABOURERS ARE YOU CALLED: THE WORLD TREMBLES AT OUR NAME. END
BEGIN NOW A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. END
BEGIN NOW He lifted his voice above it
boldly:

--BUT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HAD THE YOUTHFUL MOSES LISTENED TO AND
ACCEPTED THAT VIEW OF LIFE, HAD HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND BOWED HIS WILL AND
BOWED HIS SPIRIT BEFORE THAT ARROGANT ADMONITION HE WOULD NEVER HAVE
BROUGHT THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE OF BONDAGE, NOR FOLLOWED THE
PILLAR OF THE CLOUD BY DAY. END
BEGIN NOW HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE ETERNAL
AMID LIGHTNINGS ON SINAI'S MOUNTAINTOP NOR EVER HAVE COME DOWN WITH THE
LIGHT OF INSPIRATION SHINING IN HIS COUNTENANCE AND BEARING IN HIS ARMS
THE TABLES OF THE LAW, GRAVEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE OUTLAW. END
BEGIN NOW He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence. END
BEGIN NOW OMINOUS--FOR HIM! END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy said not without regret:

--And yet he died without having entered the land of promise. END
BEGIN NOW --A sudden--at--the--moment--though--from--lingering--illness--
often--previously--expectorated--demise, Lenehan added. END
BEGIN NOW And with a
great future behind him. END
BEGIN NOW The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and
pattering up the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW --That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. END
BEGIN NOW Gone with the wind. END
BEGIN NOW Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. END
BEGIN NOW Miles of ears of porches. END
BEGIN NOW The tribune's words, howled and scattered to the four winds. END
BEGIN NOW A people
sheltered within his voice. END
BEGIN NOW Dead noise. END
BEGIN NOW Akasic records of all that ever
anywhere wherever was. END
BEGIN NOW Love and laud him: me no more. END
BEGIN NOW I have money. END
BEGIN NOW --Gentlemen, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW As the next motion on the agenda paper may I
suggest that the house do now adjourn? END
BEGIN NOW --You take my breath away. END
BEGIN NOW It is not perchance a French compliment? END
BEGIN NOW Mr
O'Madden Burke asked. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,
metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry. END
BEGIN NOW --That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. END
BEGIN NOW All that are in favour
say ay, Lenehan announced. END
BEGIN NOW The contrary no. END
BEGIN NOW I declare it carried. END
BEGIN NOW To which
particular boosing shed? END
BEGIN NOW ... My casting vote is: Mooney's! END
BEGIN NOW He led the way, admonishing:

--We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? END
BEGIN NOW Yes,
we will not. END
BEGIN NOW By no manner of means. END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally's lunge of his
umbrella:

--Lay on, Macduff! END
BEGIN NOW --Chip of the old block! END
BEGIN NOW the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the
shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW Let us go. END
BEGIN NOW Where are those blasted keys? END
BEGIN NOW He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets. END
BEGIN NOW --Foot and mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I know. END
BEGIN NOW That'll be all right. END
BEGIN NOW That'll go in. END
BEGIN NOW Where are
they? END
BEGIN NOW That's all right. END
BEGIN NOW He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office. END
BEGIN NOW LET US HOPE


J. J. O'Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:

--I hope you will live to see it published. END
BEGIN NOW Myles, one moment. END
BEGIN NOW He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him. END
BEGIN NOW --Come along, Stephen, the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW That is fine, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW It has
the prophetic vision. END
BEGIN NOW FUIT ILIUM! END
BEGIN NOW The sack of windy Troy. END
BEGIN NOW Kingdoms of this
world. END
BEGIN NOW The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today. END
BEGIN NOW The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and
rushed out into the street, yelling:

--Racing special! END
BEGIN NOW Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW I have much, much to learn. END
BEGIN NOW They turned to the left along Abbey street. END
BEGIN NOW --I have a vision too, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes? END
BEGIN NOW the professor said, skipping to get into step. END
BEGIN NOW Crawford will
follow. END
BEGIN NOW Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:

--Racing special! END
BEGIN NOW DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN


Dubliners. END
BEGIN NOW --Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty
and fiftythree years in Fumbally's lane. END
BEGIN NOW --Where is that? END
BEGIN NOW the professor asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Off Blackpitts, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Damp night reeking of hungry dough. END
BEGIN NOW Against the wall. END
BEGIN NOW Face
glistering tallow under her fustian shawl. END
BEGIN NOW Frantic hearts. END
BEGIN NOW Akasic records. END
BEGIN NOW Quicker, darlint! END
BEGIN NOW On now. END
BEGIN NOW Dare it. END
BEGIN NOW Let there be life. END
BEGIN NOW --They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson's pillar. END
BEGIN NOW They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. END
BEGIN NOW They
shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with
the blade of a knife. END
BEGIN NOW Two and three in silver and one and seven in
coppers. END
BEGIN NOW They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their
umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain. END
BEGIN NOW --Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said. END
BEGIN NOW LIFE ON THE RAW


--They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at
the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,
proprietress ... END
BEGIN NOW They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at
the foot of Nelson's pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. END
BEGIN NOW They give
two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle
slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid
of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising

airslits. END

has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady
who got a bottleful from a passionist father. END

BEGIN NOW Vestal virgins. END
BEGIN NOW I can see
them. END
BEGIN NOW What's keeping our friend? END
BEGIN NOW He turned. END
BEGIN NOW A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in
all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. END
BEGIN NOW Hard after them
Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face,
talking with J. J. O'Molloy. END
BEGIN NOW --Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm. END
BEGIN NOW He set off again to walk by Stephen's side. END
BEGIN NOW RETURN OF BLOOM


--Yes, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I see them. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
offices of the IRISH CATHOLIC AND DUBLIN PENNY JOURNAL, called:

--Mr Crawford! END
BEGIN NOW A moment! END
BEGIN NOW --TELEGRAPH! END
BEGIN NOW Racing special! END
BEGIN NOW --What is it? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace. END
BEGIN NOW A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom's face:

--Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! END
BEGIN NOW A child bit by a bellows! END
BEGIN NOW INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR


--Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,
puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW I spoke with Mr Keyes
just now. END
BEGIN NOW He'll give a renewal for two months, he says. END
BEGIN NOW After he'll see. END
BEGIN NOW But he wants a par to call attention in the TELEGRAPH too, the Saturday
pink. END
BEGIN NOW And he wants it copied if it's not too late I told councillor
Nannetti from the KILKENNY PEOPLE. END
BEGIN NOW I can have access to it in the national
library. END
BEGIN NOW House of keys, don't you see? END
BEGIN NOW His name is Keyes. END
BEGIN NOW It's a play on
the name. END
BEGIN NOW But he practically promised he'd give the renewal. END
BEGIN NOW But he wants
just a little puff. END
BEGIN NOW What will I tell him, Mr Crawford? END
BEGIN NOW K.M.A. END
BEGIN NOW --Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said throwing out
his arm for emphasis. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him that straight from the stable. END
BEGIN NOW A bit nervy. END
BEGIN NOW Look out for squalls. END
BEGIN NOW All off for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW Arm in arm. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan's yachting cap on the cadge beyond. END
BEGIN NOW Usual blarney. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is
that young Dedalus the moving spirit. END
BEGIN NOW Has a good pair of boots on him
today. END
BEGIN NOW Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. END
BEGIN NOW Been walking in muck
somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Careless chap. END
BEGIN NOW What was he doing in Irishtown? END
BEGIN NOW --Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I
suppose it's worth a short par. END
BEGIN NOW He'd give the ad, I think. END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell
him ...


    K.M.R.I.A. END
BEGIN NOW --He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his
shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW Any time he likes, tell him. END
BEGIN NOW While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode
on jerkily. END
BEGIN NOW RAISING THE WIND


--NULLA BONA, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. END
BEGIN NOW I'm up to
here. END
BEGIN NOW I've been through the hoop myself. END
BEGIN NOW I was looking for a fellow to
back a bill for me no later than last week. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW You must take the
will for the deed. END
BEGIN NOW With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind
anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. END
BEGIN NOW They caught
up on the others and walked abreast. END
BEGIN NOW --When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty
fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the
railings. END
BEGIN NOW --Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. END
BEGIN NOW Two old
Dublin women on the top of Nelson's pillar. END
BEGIN NOW SOME COLUMN!--
    THAT'S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID


--That's new, Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW That's copy. END
BEGIN NOW Out for the waxies
Dargle. END
BEGIN NOW Two old trickies, what? END
BEGIN NOW --But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. END
BEGIN NOW They see the
roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines' blue
dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's. END
BEGIN NOW But it makes them giddy to
look so they pull up their skirts ...


    THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES


--Easy all, Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW No poetic licence. END
BEGIN NOW We're in the
archdiocese here. END
BEGIN NOW --And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue
of the onehandled adulterer. END
BEGIN NOW --Onehandled adulterer! END
BEGIN NOW the professor cried. END
BEGIN NOW I like that. END
BEGIN NOW I see the idea. END
BEGIN NOW I see what you mean. END
BEGIN NOW DAMES DONATE DUBLIN'S CITS SPEEDPILLS
    VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF


--It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too
tired to look up or down or to speak. END
BEGIN NOW They put the bag of plums between
them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their
handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting
the plumstones slowly out between the railings. END
BEGIN NOW He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan and Mr O'Madden
Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney's. END
BEGIN NOW --Finished? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW So long as they do no worse. END
BEGIN NOW SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON
    PROBOSCIS. END
BEGIN NOW SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS. END
BEGIN NOW ITHACANS
    VOW PEN IS CHAMP. END
BEGIN NOW --You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of
Gorgias, the sophist. END
BEGIN NOW It is said of him that none could tell if he were
bitterer against others or against himself. END
BEGIN NOW He was the son of a noble and
a bondwoman. END
BEGIN NOW And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty
from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Penelope. END
BEGIN NOW Penelope Rich. END
BEGIN NOW They made ready to cross O'Connell street. END
BEGIN NOW HELLO THERE, CENTRAL! END
BEGIN NOW At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless
trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, Rathfarnham,
Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend and
Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines,
all still, becalmed in short circuit. END
BEGIN NOW Hackney cars, cabs, delivery
waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with
rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT?--AND LIKEWISE--WHERE? END
BEGIN NOW --But what do you call it? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford asked. END
BEGIN NOW Where did they get the
plums? END
BEGIN NOW VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. END
BEGIN NOW SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES. END
BEGIN NOW --Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to
reflect. END
BEGIN NOW Call it, let me see. END
BEGIN NOW Call it: DEUS NOBIS HAEC OTIA FECIT. END
BEGIN NOW --No, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW I call it A PISGAH SIGHT OF PALESTINE OR THE PARABLE
OF THE PLUMS. END
BEGIN NOW --I see, the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW He laughed richly. END
BEGIN NOW --I see, he said again with new pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Moses and the promised land. END
BEGIN NOW We
gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O'Molloy. END
BEGIN NOW HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY


J. J. O'Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and
held his peace. END
BEGIN NOW --I see, the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW He halted on sir John Gray's pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson
through the meshes of his wry smile. END
BEGIN NOW DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING
    FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. END
BEGIN NOW ANNE WIMBLES, FLO
    WANGLES--YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM? END
BEGIN NOW --Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. END
BEGIN NOW That tickles me, I must
say. END
BEGIN NOW --Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty's
truth was known. END

Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:

--Mind! END

BEGIN NOW When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:

--What is this he is? END
BEGIN NOW Isn't he in the insurance line? END
BEGIN NOW --He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW He does canvassing for the
FREEMAN. END
BEGIN NOW --I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW Is he in trouble? END
BEGIN NOW --Trouble? END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW Not that I heard of. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW --I noticed he was in mourning. END
BEGIN NOW --Was he? END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW So he was, faith. END
BEGIN NOW I asked him how was all at
home. END
BEGIN NOW You're right, by God. END
BEGIN NOW So he was. END
BEGIN NOW --I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a
gentleman is in trouble that way. END
BEGIN NOW It only brings it up fresh in their
minds. END
BEGIN NOW --It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW I met him the day before
yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's
wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home
to his better half. END
BEGIN NOW She's well nourished, I tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Plovers on toast. END
BEGIN NOW --And is he doing for the FREEMAN? END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn pursed his lips. END
BEGIN NOW ---He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. END
BEGIN NOW You can make bacon of
that. END
BEGIN NOW --How so? END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book. END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. END
BEGIN NOW He
winked. END
BEGIN NOW --He's in the craft, he said. END
BEGIN NOW ---Do you tell me so? END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW --Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW Ancient free and accepted order. END
BEGIN NOW He's
an excellent brother. END
BEGIN NOW Light, life and love, by God. END
BEGIN NOW They give him a leg
up. END
BEGIN NOW I was told that by a--well, I won't say who. END
BEGIN NOW --Is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW --O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW They stick to you when you're
down. END
BEGIN NOW I know a fellow was trying to get into it. END
BEGIN NOW But they're as close as
damn it. END
BEGIN NOW By God they did right to keep the women out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:

--Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! END
BEGIN NOW --There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find
out what they do be doing. END
BEGIN NOW But be damned but they smelt her out and swore
her in on the spot a master mason. END
BEGIN NOW That was one of the saint Legers of
Doneraile. END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:

--And is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW Decent quiet man he is. END
BEGIN NOW I often saw him in here and
I never once saw him--you know, over the line. END
BEGIN NOW --God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. END
BEGIN NOW Slips
off when the fun gets too hot. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't you see him look at his watch? END
BEGIN NOW Ah,
you weren't there. END
BEGIN NOW If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he
outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. END
BEGIN NOW Declare to God he
does. END
BEGIN NOW --There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW He's a safe man, I'd say. END
BEGIN NOW --He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. END
BEGIN NOW He's been known to
put his hand down too to help a fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Give the devil his due. END
BEGIN NOW O, Bloom
has his good points. END
BEGIN NOW But there's one thing he'll never do. END
BEGIN NOW His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog. END
BEGIN NOW --I know, Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW --Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford followed frowning, a
plaining hand on his claret waistcoat. END
BEGIN NOW --Day, Mr Byrne. END
BEGIN NOW --Day, gentlemen. END
BEGIN NOW They paused at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW --Who's standing? END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard asked. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, what'll it be? END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard asked. END
BEGIN NOW --I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said. END
BEGIN NOW --How much? END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard cried. END
BEGIN NOW Since when, for God' sake? END
BEGIN NOW What's yours,
Tom? END
BEGIN NOW --How is the main drainage? END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn asked, sipping. END
BEGIN NOW For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped. END
BEGIN NOW --Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW --Certainly, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates. END
BEGIN NOW --Lord love a duck, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Look at what I'm standing drinks to! END
BEGIN NOW Cold
water and gingerpop! END
BEGIN NOW Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg. END
BEGIN NOW He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. END
BEGIN NOW A dead snip. END
BEGIN NOW --Zinfandel is it? END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn asked. END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before
him. END
BEGIN NOW --That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking. END
BEGIN NOW --Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford nodded and drank. END
BEGIN NOW --Is it Zinfandel? END
BEGIN NOW --Say nothing! END
BEGIN NOW Bantam Lyons winked. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to plunge five bob on my
own. END
BEGIN NOW --Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard
said. END
BEGIN NOW Who gave it to you? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting. END
BEGIN NOW --So long! END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW The others turned. END
BEGIN NOW --That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered. END
BEGIN NOW --Prrwht! END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard said with scorn. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two of
your small Jamesons after that and a ...

--Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, Paddy Leonard said. END
BEGIN NOW A suckingbottle for the baby. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
smooth. END
BEGIN NOW Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. END
BEGIN NOW Then with
those Rontgen rays searchlight you could. END
BEGIN NOW At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. END
BEGIN NOW Surfeit. END
BEGIN NOW Returned with thanks
having fully digested the contents. END
BEGIN NOW First sweet then savoury. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom
coasted warily. END
BEGIN NOW Ruminants. END
BEGIN NOW His second course. END
BEGIN NOW Their upper jaw they move. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his? END
BEGIN NOW Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Lean people long mouths. END
BEGIN NOW Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent
free. END
BEGIN NOW Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering. END
BEGIN NOW He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:

    M'INVITASTI. END
BEGIN NOW Feel better. END
BEGIN NOW Burgundy. END
BEGIN NOW Good pick me up. END
BEGIN NOW Who distilled first? END
BEGIN NOW Some chap in
the blues. END
BEGIN NOW Dutch courage. END
BEGIN NOW That KILKENNY PEOPLE in the national library
now I must. END
BEGIN NOW Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber,
turned back his thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW They could: and watch it all the way down,
swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the
body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of
intestines like pipes. END
BEGIN NOW But the poor buffer would have to stand all the
time with his insides entrails on show. END
BEGIN NOW Science. END
BEGIN NOW --A CENAR TECO. END
BEGIN NOW What does that TECO mean? END
BEGIN NOW Tonight perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW DON GIOVANNI, THOU HAST ME INVITED
    TO COME TO SUPPER TONIGHT,
    THE RUM THE RUMDUM. END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't go properly. END
BEGIN NOW Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. END
BEGIN NOW That'll be two pounds ten about
two pounds eight. END
BEGIN NOW Three Hynes owes me. END
BEGIN NOW Two eleven. END
BEGIN NOW Prescott's dyeworks
van over there. END
BEGIN NOW If I get Billy Prescott's ad: two fifteen. END
BEGIN NOW Five guineas
about. END
BEGIN NOW On the pig's back. END
BEGIN NOW Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new
garters. END
BEGIN NOW Today. END
BEGIN NOW Today. END
BEGIN NOW Not think. END
BEGIN NOW Tour the south then. END
BEGIN NOW What about English wateringplaces? END
BEGIN NOW Brighton,
Margate. END
BEGIN NOW Piers by moonlight. END
BEGIN NOW Her voice floating out. END
BEGIN NOW Those lovely seaside
girls. END
BEGIN NOW Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought,
gnawing a crusted knuckle. END
BEGIN NOW Handy man wants job. END
BEGIN NOW Small wages. END
BEGIN NOW Will eat
anything. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and
passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. END
BEGIN NOW WHY I LEFT THE CHURCH
OF ROME? END
BEGIN NOW BIRDS' NEST. END
BEGIN NOW Women run him. END
BEGIN NOW They say they used to give pauper
children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight. END
BEGIN NOW Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. END
BEGIN NOW Same
bait. END
BEGIN NOW Why we left the church of Rome. END
BEGIN NOW A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. END
BEGIN NOW No
tram in sight. END
BEGIN NOW Wants to cross. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you want to cross? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW The blind stripling did not answer. END
BEGIN NOW His wallface frowned weakly. END
BEGIN NOW He moved
his head uncertainly. END
BEGIN NOW --You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Molesworth street is opposite. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want to cross? END
BEGIN NOW There's nothing in the way. END
BEGIN NOW The cane moved out trembling to the left. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom's eye followed its
line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. END
BEGIN NOW Where I saw
his brillantined hair just when I was. END
BEGIN NOW Horse drooping. END
BEGIN NOW Driver in John
Long's. END
BEGIN NOW Slaking his drouth. END
BEGIN NOW --There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. END
BEGIN NOW I'll see you
across. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want to go to Molesworth street? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, the stripling answered. END
BEGIN NOW South Frederick street. END
BEGIN NOW --Come, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide
it forward. END
BEGIN NOW Say something to him. END
BEGIN NOW Better not do the condescending. END
BEGIN NOW They mistrust what
you tell them. END
BEGIN NOW Pass a common remark. END
BEGIN NOW --The rain kept off. END
BEGIN NOW No answer. END
BEGIN NOW Stains on his coat. END
BEGIN NOW Slobbers his food, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Tastes all different
for him. END
BEGIN NOW Have to be spoonfed first. END
BEGIN NOW Like a child's hand, his hand. END
BEGIN NOW Like
Milly's was. END
BEGIN NOW Sensitive. END
BEGIN NOW Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if he
has a name. END
BEGIN NOW Van. END
BEGIN NOW Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired drudge
get his doze. END
BEGIN NOW That's right. END
BEGIN NOW Clear. END
BEGIN NOW Behind a bull: in front of a horse. END
BEGIN NOW --Thanks, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Knows I'm a man. END
BEGIN NOW Voice. END
BEGIN NOW --Right now? END
BEGIN NOW First turn to the left. END
BEGIN NOW The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his
cane back, feeling again. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
tweed. END
BEGIN NOW Poor young fellow! END
BEGIN NOW How on earth did he know that van was there? END
BEGIN NOW Must have felt it. END
BEGIN NOW See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of
volume. END
BEGIN NOW Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder
would he feel it if something was removed. END
BEGIN NOW Feel a gap. END
BEGIN NOW Queer idea of
Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. END
BEGIN NOW Could he walk
in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? END
BEGIN NOW Bloodless pious face like a fellow
going in to be a priest. END
BEGIN NOW Penrose! END
BEGIN NOW That was that chap's name. END
BEGIN NOW Look at all the things they can learn to do. END
BEGIN NOW Read with their fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Tune pianos. END
BEGIN NOW Or we are surprised they have any brains. END
BEGIN NOW Why we think a
deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. END
BEGIN NOW Of course the other senses are more. END
BEGIN NOW Embroider. END
BEGIN NOW Plait baskets. END
BEGIN NOW People
ought to help. END
BEGIN NOW Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday. END
BEGIN NOW Hates sewing. END
BEGIN NOW Might take an objection. END
BEGIN NOW Dark men they call them. END
BEGIN NOW Sense of smell must be stronger too. END
BEGIN NOW Smells on all sides, bunched
together. END
BEGIN NOW Each street different smell. END
BEGIN NOW Each person too. END
BEGIN NOW Then the spring,
the summer: smells. END
BEGIN NOW Tastes? END
BEGIN NOW They say you can't taste wines with your eyes
shut or a cold in the head. END
BEGIN NOW Also smoke in the dark they say get no
pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW And with a woman, for instance. END
BEGIN NOW More shameless not seeing. END
BEGIN NOW That girl
passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. END
BEGIN NOW Look at me. END
BEGIN NOW I have them
all on. END
BEGIN NOW Must be strange not to see her. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of a form in his mind's eye. END
BEGIN NOW The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost
see the lines, the curves. END
BEGIN NOW His hands on her hair, for instance. END
BEGIN NOW Say it
was black, for instance. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW We call it black. END
BEGIN NOW Then passing over her
white skin. END
BEGIN NOW Different feel perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Feeling of white. END
BEGIN NOW Postoffice. END
BEGIN NOW Must answer. END
BEGIN NOW Fag today. END
BEGIN NOW Send her a postal order two
shillings, half a crown. END
BEGIN NOW Accept my little present. END
BEGIN NOW Stationer's just here
too. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Think over it. END
BEGIN NOW With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
his ears. END
BEGIN NOW Again. END
BEGIN NOW Fibres of fine fine straw. END
BEGIN NOW Then gently his finger felt
the skin of his right cheek. END
BEGIN NOW Downy hair there too. END
BEGIN NOW Not smooth enough. END
BEGIN NOW The
belly is the smoothest. END
BEGIN NOW No-one about. END
BEGIN NOW There he goes into Frederick
street. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. END
BEGIN NOW Might be settling
my braces. END
BEGIN NOW Walking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and
trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his
belly. END
BEGIN NOW But I know it's whitey yellow. END
BEGIN NOW Want to try in the dark to see. END
BEGIN NOW He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to. END
BEGIN NOW Poor fellow! END
BEGIN NOW Quite a boy. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible. END
BEGIN NOW Really terrible. END
BEGIN NOW What dreams would he
have, not seeing? END
BEGIN NOW Life a dream for him. END
BEGIN NOW Where is the justice being born
that way? END
BEGIN NOW All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and
drowned in New York. END
BEGIN NOW Holocaust. END
BEGIN NOW Karma they call that transmigration for
sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses. END
BEGIN NOW Dear,
dear, dear. END
BEGIN NOW Pity, of course: but somehow you can't cotton on to them
someway. END
BEGIN NOW Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons' hall. END
BEGIN NOW Solemn as Troy. END
BEGIN NOW After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. END
BEGIN NOW Old legal cronies cracking a
magnum. END
BEGIN NOW Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school. END
BEGIN NOW I sentenced him to ten years. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose he'd turn up his nose at that
stuff I drank. END
BEGIN NOW Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle. END

BEGIN NOW First I must. END
BEGIN NOW Library. END
BEGIN NOW Straw hat in sunlight. END

BEGIN NOW Is it? END
BEGIN NOW Almost certain. END
BEGIN NOW Won't look. END

BEGIN NOW Why did I? END
BEGIN NOW Too heady. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it is. END

BEGIN NOW Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Handsome building. END
BEGIN NOW Sir Thomas Deane designed. END
BEGIN NOW Not following me? END
BEGIN NOW Didn't see me perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Light in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. END

BEGIN NOW Cold statues:
quiet there. END
BEGIN NOW Safe in a minute. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't see me. END
BEGIN NOW After two. END
BEGIN NOW Just at the gate. END
BEGIN NOW My heart! END
BEGIN NOW His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. END
BEGIN NOW Sir Thomas
Deane was the Greek architecture. END
BEGIN NOW Look for something I. END
BEGIN NOW His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath
Netaim. END
BEGIN NOW Where did I? END
BEGIN NOW Busy looking. END
BEGIN NOW He thrust back quick Agendath. END
BEGIN NOW Afternoon she said. END
BEGIN NOW I am looking for that. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, that. END
BEGIN NOW Try all pockets. END
BEGIN NOW Handker. END
BEGIN NOW FREEMAN. END
BEGIN NOW Where did I? END

naughtn't when a lady's ashowing of her elemental. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. END
BEGIN NOW He bore in his hand with grace
a notebook, new, large, clean, bright. END
BEGIN NOW --That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet's musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato's. END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:

--Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle
with Plato. END
BEGIN NOW --Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
commonwealth? END
BEGIN NOW Unsheathe your dagger definitions. END
BEGIN NOW Horseness is the whatness of allhorse. END

BEGIN NOW Through spaces
smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after Blake's
buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. END
BEGIN NOW Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague. END
BEGIN NOW --Haines is gone, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --Is he? END
BEGIN NOW --I was showing him Jubainville's book. END
BEGIN NOW He's quite enthusiastic, don't
you know, about Hyde's LOVESONGS OF CONNACHT. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't bring him in to
hear the discussion. END
BEGIN NOW He's gone to Gill's to buy it. END
BEGIN NOW BOUND THEE FORTH, MY BOOKLET, QUICK

sixshilling novel, the musichall song. END
BEGIN NOW France produces the finest flower

BEGIN NOW From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW --Mallarme, don't you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW The one about HAMLET. END
BEGIN NOW He says: IL SE PROMENE, LISANT AU LIVRE DE LUI-MEME, don't you know,

BEGIN NOW The French point
of view. END
BEGIN NOW HAMLET OU ...

--The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended. END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton laughed. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent people, no doubt, but
distressingly shortsighted in some matters. END
BEGIN NOW Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder. END
BEGIN NOW --A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. END

in his palms. END

BEGIN NOW LIST! END
BEGIN NOW LIST! END
BEGIN NOW O LIST! END
BEGIN NOW My flesh hears him: creeping, hears. END
BEGIN NOW IF THOU DIDST EVER ...


--What is a ghost? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said with tingling energy. END
BEGIN NOW One who has faded
into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
manners. END
BEGIN NOW Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
lies from virgin Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Who is the ghost from LIMBO PATRUM, returning to
the world that has forgotten him? END
BEGIN NOW Who is King Hamlet? END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge. END
BEGIN NOW Lifted. END
BEGIN NOW --It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a
swift glance their hearing. END
BEGIN NOW The flag is up on the playhouse by the
bankside. END
BEGIN NOW The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. END
BEGIN NOW Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the
groundlings. END
BEGIN NOW Local colour. END
BEGIN NOW Work in all you know. END
BEGIN NOW Make them accomplices. END
BEGIN NOW --Shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in Silver street and walks by
the swanmews along the riverbank. END
BEGIN NOW But he does not stay to feed the pen
chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. END
BEGIN NOW The swan of Avon has
other thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW Composition of place. END
BEGIN NOW Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me! END
BEGIN NOW --The play begins. END
BEGIN NOW A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. END
BEGIN NOW It is the
ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who
has studied HAMLET all the years of his life which were not vanity in
order to play the part of the spectre. END
BEGIN NOW He speaks the words to Burbage,
the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth,
calling him by a name:

    HAMLET, I AM THY FATHER'S SPIRIT,

bidding him list. END
BEGIN NOW To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,
young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died
in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever. END
BEGIN NOW Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
prince Hamlet's twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you
are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the
guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway? END
BEGIN NOW --But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
impatiently. END
BEGIN NOW Art thou there, truepenny? END
BEGIN NOW --Interesting only to the parish clerk. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, we have the plays. END
BEGIN NOW I mean
when we read the poetry of KING LEAR what is it to us how the poet lived? END
BEGIN NOW As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l'Isle has
said. END
BEGIN NOW Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet's
drinking, the poet's debts. END
BEGIN NOW We have KING LEAR: and it is immortal. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best's face, appealed to, agreed. END
BEGIN NOW FLOW OVER THEM WITH YOUR WAVES AND WITH YOUR WATERS, MANANAAN,
    MANANAAN MACLIR ...

A.E.I.O.U. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton's carping voice asked. END
BEGIN NOW Her ghost at least has been laid for
ever. END
BEGIN NOW She died, for literature at least, before she was born. END
BEGIN NOW --She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. END
BEGIN NOW She
saw him into and out of the world. END
BEGIN NOW She took his first embraces. END
BEGIN NOW She bore
his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed
when he lay on his deathbed. END
BEGIN NOW Mother's deathbed. END
BEGIN NOW Candle. END
BEGIN NOW The sheeted mirror. END
BEGIN NOW Who brought me into this
world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. END
BEGIN NOW LILIATA
RUTILANTIUM. END
BEGIN NOW I wept alone. END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp. END
BEGIN NOW --The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
out of it as quickly and as best he could. END
BEGIN NOW --Bosh! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said rudely. END
BEGIN NOW A man of genius makes no mistakes. END
BEGIN NOW His
errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery. END
BEGIN NOW Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous. END
BEGIN NOW --A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
discovery, one should imagine. END
BEGIN NOW What useful discovery did Socrates learn
from Xanthippe? END
BEGIN NOW --Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
into the world. END
BEGIN NOW What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (ABSIT NOMEN! END
BEGIN NOW ),
Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. END
BEGIN NOW But
neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the
archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock. END
BEGIN NOW --But Ann Hathaway? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, we seem
to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her. END
BEGIN NOW His look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to chide
them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though
maligned. END
BEGIN NOW --He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory. END
BEGIN NOW He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME. END
BEGIN NOW If the earthquake did not time it we should
know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the
studded bridle and her blue windows. END
BEGIN NOW That memory, VENUS AND ADONIS, lay
in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. END
BEGIN NOW Is Katharine the
shrew illfavoured? END
BEGIN NOW Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think
the writer of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in
the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire
to lie withal? END
BEGIN NOW Good: he left her and gained the world of men. END
BEGIN NOW But his
boywomen are the women of a boy. END
BEGIN NOW Their life, thought, speech are lent
them by males. END
BEGIN NOW He chose badly? END
BEGIN NOW He was chosen, it seems to me. END
BEGIN NOW If others
have their will Ann hath a way. END
BEGIN NOW By cock, she was to blame. END
BEGIN NOW She put the
comether on him, sweet and twentysix. END
BEGIN NOW The greyeyed goddess who bends over
the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is
a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger
than herself. END
BEGIN NOW And my turn? END
BEGIN NOW When? END
BEGIN NOW Come! END
BEGIN NOW --Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
brightly. END
BEGIN NOW He murmured then with blond delight for all:

BEGIN NOW Paris: the wellpleased pleaser. END
BEGIN NOW A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its

BEGIN NOW Whither away? END
BEGIN NOW Exploitable ground. END
BEGIN NOW --Are you going? END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton's active eyebrows asked. END
BEGIN NOW Shall we see you
at Moore's tonight? END
BEGIN NOW Piper is coming. END
BEGIN NOW --Piper! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best piped. END
BEGIN NOW Is Piper back? END
BEGIN NOW Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper. END

    FOR YEARS IN THIS FLESHCASE A SHESOUL DWELT. END
BEGIN NOW --They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said,
friendly and earnest. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a
sheaf of our younger poets' verses. END
BEGIN NOW We are all looking forward anxiously. END
BEGIN NOW Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted,
shone. END
BEGIN NOW See this. END
BEGIN NOW Remember. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his
ashplanthandle over his knee. END
BEGIN NOW My casque and sword. END
BEGIN NOW Touch lightly with two
index fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Aristotle's experiment. END
BEGIN NOW One or two? END
BEGIN NOW Necessity is that in
virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW Argal, one

BEGIN NOW Listen. END
BEGIN NOW Young Colum and Starkey. END
BEGIN NOW George Roberts is doing the commercial part. END
BEGIN NOW Longworth will give it a good puff in the EXPRESS. END
BEGIN NOW O, will he? END
BEGIN NOW I liked
Colum's DROVER. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think
he has genius really? END
BEGIN NOW Yeats admired his line: AS IN WILD EARTH A GRECIAN
VASE. END
BEGIN NOW Did he? END
BEGIN NOW I hope you'll be able to come tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Malachi Mulligan is
coming too. END
BEGIN NOW Moore asked him to bring Haines. END
BEGIN NOW Did you hear Miss Mitchell's
joke about Moore and Martyn? END
BEGIN NOW That Moore is Martyn's wild oats? END
BEGIN NOW Awfully
clever, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. END
BEGIN NOW Our
national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. END

BEGIN NOW O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. END
BEGIN NOW And
his Dulcinea? END

BEGIN NOW We are
becoming important, it seems. END
BEGIN NOW Cordelia. END
BEGIN NOW CORDOGLIO. END
BEGIN NOW Lir's loneliest daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Nookshotten. END
BEGIN NOW Now your best French polish. END
BEGIN NOW --Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. END
BEGIN NOW If you will be
so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman ...

--O, yes. END
BEGIN NOW If he considers it important it will go in. END
BEGIN NOW We have so much
correspondence. END
BEGIN NOW --I understand, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW God ild you. END
BEGIN NOW The pigs' paper. END
BEGIN NOW Bullockbefriending. END
BEGIN NOW Synge has promised me an article for DANA too. END
BEGIN NOW Are we going to be read? END
BEGIN NOW I
feel we are. END
BEGIN NOW The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. END
BEGIN NOW I hope you will
come round tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Bring Starkey. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen sat down. END
BEGIN NOW The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. END
BEGIN NOW Blushing, his mask said:

--Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating. END
BEGIN NOW He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:

--Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet? END
BEGIN NOW Alarmed face asks me. END
BEGIN NOW Why did he come? END
BEGIN NOW Courtesy or an inward light? END
BEGIN NOW --Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
first a sundering. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks, from
hue and cry. END
BEGIN NOW Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. END
BEGIN NOW Women he won
to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully
tapsters' wives. END
BEGIN NOW Fox and geese. END
BEGIN NOW And in New Place a slack dishonoured body
that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves
falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes. END
BEGIN NOW So you think ... END
BEGIN NOW The door closed behind the outgoer. END
BEGIN NOW Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
brooding air. END
BEGIN NOW A vestal's lamp. END
BEGIN NOW Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to do
had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of
the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when
he lived among women. END
BEGIN NOW Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words. END
BEGIN NOW Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. END
BEGIN NOW And I heard the voice
of that Egyptian highpriest. END
BEGIN NOW IN PAINTED CHAMBERS LOADED WITH TILEBOOKS. END
BEGIN NOW They are still. END
BEGIN NOW Once quick in the brains of men. END
BEGIN NOW Still: but an itch of
death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
their will. END
BEGIN NOW --Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
enigmatic. END
BEGIN NOW We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. END
BEGIN NOW Not even so
much. END
BEGIN NOW Others abide our question. END
BEGIN NOW A shadow hangs over all the rest. END
BEGIN NOW --But HAMLET is so personal, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best pleaded. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, a kind of
private paper, don't you know, of his private life. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I don't care
a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty ... END
BEGIN NOW He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance. END
BEGIN NOW His private papers in the original. END
BEGIN NOW TA AN BAD AR AN TIR. END
BEGIN NOW TAIM IN MO
SHAGART. END
BEGIN NOW Put beurla on it, littlejohn. END
BEGIN NOW Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:

--I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I
may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare
is Hamlet you have a stern task before you. END
BEGIN NOW Bear with me. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
wrinkled brows. END
BEGIN NOW A basilisk. END
BEGIN NOW E QUANDO VEDE L'UOMO L'ATTOSCA. END
BEGIN NOW Messer
Brunetto, I thank thee for the word. END
BEGIN NOW --As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from
day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave
and unweave his image. END
BEGIN NOW And as the mole on my right breast is where it was
when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time
after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the
unliving son looks forth. END
BEGIN NOW In the intense instant of imagination, when the
mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am
and that which in possibility I may come to be. END
BEGIN NOW So in the future, the
sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection
from that which then I shall be. END
BEGIN NOW Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mr Best said youngly. END
BEGIN NOW I feel Hamlet quite young. END
BEGIN NOW The bitterness
might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
the son. END
BEGIN NOW Has the wrong sow by the lug. END
BEGIN NOW He is in my father. END
BEGIN NOW I am in his son. END
BEGIN NOW --That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow. END
BEGIN NOW --If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug
in the market. END
BEGIN NOW The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan admired
so much breathe another spirit. END
BEGIN NOW --The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed. END
BEGIN NOW --There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
sundering. END
BEGIN NOW Said that. END
BEGIN NOW --If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
the hell of time of KING LEAR, OTHELLO, HAMLET, TROILUS AND CRESSIDA,
look to see when and how the shadow lifts. END
BEGIN NOW What softens the heart of a
man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
prince of Tyre? END
BEGIN NOW Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded. END
BEGIN NOW --A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina. END
BEGIN NOW --The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
quantity, John Eglinton detected. END
BEGIN NOW The highroads are dreary but they lead
to the town. END
BEGIN NOW Good Bacon: gone musty. END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. END
BEGIN NOW Cypherjugglers
going the highroads. END
BEGIN NOW Seekers on the great quest. END
BEGIN NOW What town, good masters? END
BEGIN NOW Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. END
BEGIN NOW East of the sun, west
of the moon: TIR NA N-OG. END
BEGIN NOW Booted the twain and staved. END
BEGIN NOW HOW MANY MILES TO DUBLIN? END
BEGIN NOW THREE SCORE AND TEN, SIR. END
BEGIN NOW WILL WE BE THERE BY CANDLELIGHT? END
BEGIN NOW --Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
period. END
BEGIN NOW --Does he? END
BEGIN NOW What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
name is, say of it? END
BEGIN NOW --Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
that which was lost. END
BEGIN NOW What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's
child. END
BEGIN NOW MY DEAREST WIFE, Pericles says, WAS LIKE THIS MAID. END
BEGIN NOW Will any man
love the daughter if he has not loved the mother? END
BEGIN NOW --The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. END
BEGIN NOW L'ART D'ETRE GRAND
...

--Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,
another image? END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what you are talking about? END
BEGIN NOW Love, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Word known to all men. END
BEGIN NOW Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus ...

--His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
all experience, material and moral. END
BEGIN NOW Such an appeal will touch him. END
BEGIN NOW The
images of other males of his blood will repel him. END
BEGIN NOW He will see in them
grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself. END
BEGIN NOW The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope. END
BEGIN NOW --I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the
public. END
BEGIN NOW And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George
Bernard Shaw. END
BEGIN NOW Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. END
BEGIN NOW His articles on
Shakespeare in the SATURDAY REVIEW were surely brilliant. END
BEGIN NOW Oddly enough he
too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. END
BEGIN NOW The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. END
BEGIN NOW I own that if
the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony
with--what shall I say?--our notions of what ought not to have been. END
BEGIN NOW Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg, prize
of their fray. END
BEGIN NOW He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. END
BEGIN NOW Dost love, Miriam? END
BEGIN NOW Dost
love thy man? END
BEGIN NOW --That may be too, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW There's a saying of Goethe's which Mr
Magee likes to quote. END
BEGIN NOW Beware of what you wish for in youth because you
will get it in middle life. END
BEGIN NOW Why does he send to one who is a BUONAROBA, a
bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a
lordling to woo for him? END
BEGIN NOW He was himself a lord of language and had made
himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written ROMEO AND JULIET. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Belief in himself has been untimely killed. END
BEGIN NOW He was overborne in a
cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in
his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. END
BEGIN NOW Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. END
BEGIN NOW No later undoing will undo the
first undoing. END
BEGIN NOW The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies
ableeding. END
BEGIN NOW If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman's
invisible weapon. END
BEGIN NOW There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh
driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening
even his own understanding of himself. END
BEGIN NOW A like fate awaits him and the two
rages commingle in a whirlpool. END
BEGIN NOW They list. END
BEGIN NOW And in the porches of their ears I pour. END
BEGIN NOW --The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
porch of a sleeping ear. END
BEGIN NOW But those who are done to death in sleep cannot
know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls
with that knowledge in the life to come. END
BEGIN NOW The poisoning and the beast with
two backs that urged it King Hamlet's ghost could not know of were he not
endowed with knowledge by his creator. END
BEGIN NOW That is why the speech (his lean
unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward. END
BEGIN NOW Ravisher and
ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from Lucrece's
bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its mole
cinquespotted. END
BEGIN NOW He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to
hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. END
BEGIN NOW But, because loss
is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality,
untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed. END
BEGIN NOW His
beaver is up. END
BEGIN NOW He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore's rocks
or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him
who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the
father. END
BEGIN NOW --Amen! END

BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of
Shakespeare. END
BEGIN NOW All sides of life should be represented. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled on all sides equally. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:

--Shakespeare? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW I seem to know the name. END
BEGIN NOW A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features. END
BEGIN NOW --To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. END
BEGIN NOW The chap that writes like
Synge. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best turned to him. END
BEGIN NOW --Haines missed you, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Did you meet him? END
BEGIN NOW He'll see you after at

BEGIN NOW --I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Was he here? END
BEGIN NOW --The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired
perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. END
BEGIN NOW I hear that an actress played
Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. END

BEGIN NOW Has no-one made him out to be an

BEGIN NOW Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. END
BEGIN NOW He swears
(His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick. END
BEGIN NOW --The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said,
lifting his brilliant notebook. END
BEGIN NOW That PORTRAIT OF MR W. H. where he proves
that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues. END

BEGIN NOW Or Hughie Wills? END
BEGIN NOW Mr William Himself. END
BEGIN NOW W. H.: who am I? END
BEGIN NOW --I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. END
BEGIN NOW Of
course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the
colour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. END

BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. END
BEGIN NOW Then, his head
wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW His mobile
lips read, smiling with new delight. END
BEGIN NOW --Telegram! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful inspiration! END
BEGIN NOW Telegram! END
BEGIN NOW A papal bull! END
BEGIN NOW He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:

--THE SENTIMENTALIST IS HE WHO WOULD ENJOY WITHOUT INCURRING THE IMMENSE

BEGIN NOW O, you peerless mummer! END
BEGIN NOW O, you

BEGIN NOW Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a
querulous brogue:

--It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were,
Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas murmur we did

BEGIN NOW And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's

BEGIN NOW He wailed:

--And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your
conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the
drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen laughed. END
BEGIN NOW Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down. END
BEGIN NOW --The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. END
BEGIN NOW He heard
you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. END
BEGIN NOW He's out in pampooties to murder
you. END
BEGIN NOW --Me! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen exclaimed. END
BEGIN NOW That was your contribution to literature. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping
ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW --Murder you! END
BEGIN NOW he laughed. END

BEGIN NOW What
is it? END
BEGIN NOW --There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and
offering a card. END
BEGIN NOW From the FREEMAN. END
BEGIN NOW He wants to see the files of the
KILKENNY PEOPLE for last year. END
BEGIN NOW --Certainly, certainly, certainly. END
BEGIN NOW Is the gentleman? END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,
asked, creaked, asked:

--Is he? END
BEGIN NOW ... O, there! END
BEGIN NOW Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. END
BEGIN NOW In the daylit corridor he talked
with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most
honest broadbrim. END
BEGIN NOW --This gentleman? END
BEGIN NOW FREEMAN'S JOURNAL? END
BEGIN NOW KILKENNY PEOPLE? END
BEGIN NOW To be sure. END
BEGIN NOW Good
day, sir. END
BEGIN NOW KILKENNY ... We have certainly ...

A patient silhouette waited, listening. END

BEGIN NOW ... Evans, conduct this
gentleman ... END
BEGIN NOW If you just follow the atten ... Or, please allow me ... END
BEGIN NOW This way ... END
BEGIN NOW Please, sir ...

Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing
dark figure following his hasty heels. END
BEGIN NOW The door closed. END
BEGIN NOW --The sheeny! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan cried. END
BEGIN NOW He jumped up and snatched the card. END
BEGIN NOW --What's his name? END
BEGIN NOW Ikey Moses? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW He rattled on:

--Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. END
BEGIN NOW I found him over in the
museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. END
BEGIN NOW The Greek mouth that
has never been twisted in prayer. END
BEGIN NOW Every day we must do homage to her. END
BEGIN NOW LIFE OF LIFE, THY LIPS ENKINDLE. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly he turned to Stephen:

--He knows you. END
BEGIN NOW He knows your old fellow. END
BEGIN NOW O, I fear me, he is Greeker
than the Greeks. END
BEGIN NOW His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. END
BEGIN NOW Venus Kallipyge. END
BEGIN NOW O, the thunder of those loins! END
BEGIN NOW THE GOD PURSUING THE
MAIDEN HID. END
BEGIN NOW --We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval. END
BEGIN NOW We
begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at
all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome. END
BEGIN NOW --Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty
from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in
whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty
years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary
equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW His life was rich. END
BEGIN NOW His
art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art
of surfeit. END
BEGIN NOW Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of
roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. END
BEGIN NOW Sir Walter Raleigh,
when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a
pair of fancy stays. END
BEGIN NOW The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough
to vie with her of Sheba. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial
love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. END
BEGIN NOW You know Manningham's story of the burgher's wife who bade Dick Burbage
to her bed after she had seen him in RICHARD III and how Shakespeare,
overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns
and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon's
blankets: WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR CAME BEFORE RICHARD III. END
BEGIN NOW And the gay
lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady
Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the
punks of the bankside, a penny a time. END

BEGIN NOW And sir William Davenant of oxford's mother
with her cup of canary for any cockcanary. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:

--Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! END
BEGIN NOW --And Harry of six wives' daughter. END
BEGIN NOW And other lady friends from neighbour
seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. END
BEGIN NOW But all those twenty years
what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the
diamond panes? END
BEGIN NOW Do and do. END
BEGIN NOW Thing done. END
BEGIN NOW In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,
he walks, greyedauburn. END
BEGIN NOW An azured harebell like her veins. END
BEGIN NOW Lids of Juno's
eyes, violets. END
BEGIN NOW He walks. END
BEGIN NOW One life is all. END
BEGIN NOW One body. END
BEGIN NOW Do. END
BEGIN NOW But do. END
BEGIN NOW Afar, in
a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply. END
BEGIN NOW --Whom do you suspect? END
BEGIN NOW he challenged. END
BEGIN NOW --Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. END
BEGIN NOW Once spurned twice
spurned. END
BEGIN NOW But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove. END
BEGIN NOW Love that dare not speak its name. END
BEGIN NOW --As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
lord. END
BEGIN NOW Old wall where sudden lizards flash. END
BEGIN NOW At Charenton I watched them. END
BEGIN NOW --It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the
stallion. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a
shrew to wife. END
BEGIN NOW But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. END
BEGIN NOW Two
deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained
yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's brother. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet
Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. END
BEGIN NOW Once a wooer, twice a wooer. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen turned boldly in his chair. END
BEGIN NOW --The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. END
BEGIN NOW If you
deny that in the fifth scene of HAMLET he has branded her with infamy
tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
between the day she married him and the day she buried him. END
BEGIN NOW All those
women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor
dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first
to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons,
Susan, her husband too, while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use
granddaddy's words, wed her second, having killed her first. END
BEGIN NOW O, yes, mention there is. END
BEGIN NOW In the years when he was living richly in royal
London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father's
shepherd. END
BEGIN NOW Explain you then. END
BEGIN NOW Explain the swansong too wherein he has
commended her to posterity. END
BEGIN NOW He faced their silence. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Eglinton:


        You mean the will. END
BEGIN NOW But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists. END
BEGIN NOW She was entitled to her widow's dower
    At common law. END
BEGIN NOW His legal knowledge was great
    Our judges tell us. END
BEGIN NOW Him Satan fleers,
    Mocker:
        And therefore he left out her name
    From the first draft but he did not leave out
    The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
    For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
    And in London. END
BEGIN NOW And therefore when he was urged,
    As I believe, to name her
    He left her his
    Secondbest
    Bed. END
BEGIN NOW PUNKT. END
BEGIN NOW Leftherhis
    Secondbest

BEGIN NOW IN SOCIETATE HUMANA HOC EST MAXIME NECESSARIUM UT SIT AMICITIA

BEGIN NOW --Saint Thomas, Stephen began ...

--ORA PRO NOBIS, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair. END
BEGIN NOW There he keened a wailing rune. END
BEGIN NOW --POGUE MAHONE! END
BEGIN NOW ACUSHLA MACHREE! END
BEGIN NOW It's destroyed we are from this day! END
BEGIN NOW It's destroyed we are surely! END
BEGIN NOW All smiled their smiles. END
BEGIN NOW --Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy
reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different
from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his
wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. END
BEGIN NOW He means that the
love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some
stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. END
BEGIN NOW Jews, whom christians tax with
avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. END
BEGIN NOW Accusations
are made in anger. END
BEGIN NOW The christian laws which built up the hoards of the
jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their
affections too with hoops of steel. END
BEGIN NOW Whether these be sins or virtues old
Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. END
BEGIN NOW But a man who holds so tightly
to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold
tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife. END
BEGIN NOW No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant
or his maidservant or his jackass. END
BEGIN NOW --Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned. END
BEGIN NOW --Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently. END
BEGIN NOW --Which will? END
BEGIN NOW gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW We are getting mixed. END
BEGIN NOW --The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's
widow, is the will to die. END
BEGIN NOW --REQUIESCAT! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen prayed. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT OF ALL THE WILL TO DO? END
BEGIN NOW IT HAS VANISHED LONG AGO ...

slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. END

evil. END

BEGIN NOW If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with
thirtyfive years of life, NEL MEZZO DEL CAMMIN DI NOSTRA VITA, with fifty
of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you
must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. END

last man who felt himself with child. END
BEGIN NOW Fatherhood, in the sense of
conscious begetting, is unknown to man. END
BEGIN NOW It is a mystical estate, an
apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. END

BEGIN NOW --You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. END
BEGIN NOW Your own name
is strange enough. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose it explains your fantastical humour. END
BEGIN NOW Me, Magee and Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW Fabulous artificer. END
BEGIN NOW The hawklike man. END
BEGIN NOW You flew. END
BEGIN NOW Whereto? END
BEGIN NOW Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. END
BEGIN NOW Paris and back. END
BEGIN NOW Lapwing. END
BEGIN NOW Icarus. END
BEGIN NOW PATER, AIT. END
BEGIN NOW Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. END
BEGIN NOW Lapwing you are. END
BEGIN NOW Lapwing be. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:

--That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know, we
find also in the old Irish myths. END
BEGIN NOW Just what you say. END
BEGIN NOW The three brothers
Shakespeare. END
BEGIN NOW In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. END
BEGIN NOW The third
brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize. END
BEGIN NOW Best of Best brothers. END
BEGIN NOW Good, better, best. END
BEGIN NOW The quaker librarian springhalted near. END
BEGIN NOW --I should like to know, he said, which brother you ... END
BEGIN NOW I understand you
to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers ... END
BEGIN NOW But
perhaps I am anticipating? END
BEGIN NOW He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained. END
BEGIN NOW An attendant from the doorway called:

--Mr Lyster! END
BEGIN NOW Father Dineen wants ...

--O, Father Dineen! END
BEGIN NOW Directly. END
BEGIN NOW Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone. END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton touched the foil. END
BEGIN NOW --Come, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and
Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW You kept them for the last, didn't you? END
BEGIN NOW --In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and
nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW A
brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella. END
BEGIN NOW Lapwing. END
BEGIN NOW Where is your brother? END
BEGIN NOW Apothecaries' hall. END
BEGIN NOW My whetstone. END
BEGIN NOW Him, then
Cranly, Mulligan: now these. END
BEGIN NOW Speech, speech. END
BEGIN NOW But act. END
BEGIN NOW Act speech. END
BEGIN NOW They
mock to try you. END
BEGIN NOW Act. END
BEGIN NOW Be acted on. END
BEGIN NOW Lapwing. END
BEGIN NOW I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. END
BEGIN NOW My kingdom for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW On. END
BEGIN NOW --You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he
took the stuff of his plays. END
BEGIN NOW Why did he take them rather than others? END
BEGIN NOW Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed
Ann (what's in a name? END
BEGIN NOW ), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. END
BEGIN NOW Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. END
BEGIN NOW The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. END
BEGIN NOW Of all his
kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence,
the angel of the world. END
BEGIN NOW Why is the underplot of KING LEAR in which Edmund
figures lifted out of Sidney's ARCADIA and spatchcocked on to a Celtic
legend older than history? END
BEGIN NOW --That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. END
BEGIN NOW We should not now
combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. END
BEGIN NOW QUE VOULEZ-VOUS? END
BEGIN NOW Moore would say. END
BEGIN NOW He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and
makes Ulysses quote Aristotle. END
BEGIN NOW --Why? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen answered himself. END
BEGIN NOW Because the theme of the false or the
usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare,
what the poor are not, always with him. END
BEGIN NOW The note of banishment,
banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly
from THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA onward till Prospero breaks his staff,
buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. END
BEGIN NOW It doubles
itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats
itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. END
BEGIN NOW It repeats
itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter
Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. END
BEGIN NOW But it was
the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his
will and left in him a strong inclination to evil. END
BEGIN NOW The words are
those of my lords bishops of Maynooth. END
BEGIN NOW An original sin and, like original
sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. END
BEGIN NOW It is between
the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone
under which her four bones are not to be laid. END
BEGIN NOW Age has not withered it. END
BEGIN NOW Beauty and peace have not done it away. END
BEGIN NOW It is in infinite variety
everywhere in the world he has created, in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, twice
in AS YOU LIKE IT, in THE TEMPEST, in HAMLET, in MEASURE FOR MEASURE--and
in all the other plays which I have not read. END
BEGIN NOW He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage. END
BEGIN NOW Judge Eglinton summed up. END
BEGIN NOW --The truth is midway, he affirmed. END
BEGIN NOW He is the ghost and the prince. END
BEGIN NOW He is
all in all. END
BEGIN NOW --He is, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW The boy of act one is the mature man of act five. END
BEGIN NOW All in all. END
BEGIN NOW In CYMBELINE, in OTHELLO he is bawd and cuckold. END
BEGIN NOW He acts and
is acted on. END
BEGIN NOW Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he kills the
real Carmen. END
BEGIN NOW His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly
willing that the moor in him shall suffer. END
BEGIN NOW --Cuckoo! END
BEGIN NOW Cuckoo! END
BEGIN NOW Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. END
BEGIN NOW O word of fear! END
BEGIN NOW Dark dome received, reverbed. END
BEGIN NOW --And what a character is Iago! END
BEGIN NOW undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. END
BEGIN NOW When all is said Dumas FILS (or is it Dumas PERE?) END
BEGIN NOW is right. END
BEGIN NOW After God
Shakespeare has created most. END
BEGIN NOW --Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW He returns after
a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life
ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. END
BEGIN NOW Then dies. END
BEGIN NOW The motion is
ended. END
BEGIN NOW Gravediggers bury Hamlet PERE and Hamlet FILS. END
BEGIN NOW A king and a
prince at last in death, with incidental music. END
BEGIN NOW And, what though murdered
and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner,
sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be
divorced. END
BEGIN NOW If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero,
the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of love, and nuncle Richie,
the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers
go. END
BEGIN NOW Strong curtain. END
BEGIN NOW He found in the world without as actual what was in his
world within as possible. END
BEGIN NOW Maeterlinck says: IF SOCRATES LEAVE HIS HOUSE
TODAY HE WILL FIND THE SAGE SEATED ON HIS DOORSTEP. END
BEGIN NOW IF JUDAS GO FORTH
TONIGHT IT IS TO JUDAS HIS STEPS WILL TEND. END
BEGIN NOW Every life is many days,
day after day. END
BEGIN NOW We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants,
old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting
ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it
badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of
things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call DIO BOIA,
hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher,
and would be bawd and cuckold too but  that in the economy of heaven,
foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an
androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself. END
BEGIN NOW --EUREKA! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan cried. END
BEGIN NOW EUREKA! END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's
desk. END
BEGIN NOW --May I? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW The Lord has spoken to Malachi. END
BEGIN NOW He began to scribble on a slip of paper. END
BEGIN NOW Take some slips from the counter going out. END
BEGIN NOW --Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall
live. END
BEGIN NOW The rest shall keep as they are. END
BEGIN NOW He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor. END
BEGIN NOW Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
variorum edition of THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. END
BEGIN NOW --You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW You have
brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. END
BEGIN NOW Do you believe your
own theory? END
BEGIN NOW --No, Stephen said promptly. END
BEGIN NOW --Are you going to write it? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best asked. END
BEGIN NOW You ought to make it a
dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote. END
BEGIN NOW John Eclecticon doubly smiled. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment
for it since you don't believe it yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Dowden believes there is some
mystery in HAMLET but will say no more. END
BEGIN NOW Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met
in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret
is hidden in the Stratford monument. END
BEGIN NOW He is going to visit the present
duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. END
BEGIN NOW It will come as a surprise to his grace. END
BEGIN NOW But he believes his theory. END
BEGIN NOW I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. END
BEGIN NOW That is, help me to believe or help
me to unbelieve? END
BEGIN NOW Who helps to believe? END
BEGIN NOW EGOMEN. END
BEGIN NOW Who to unbelieve? END
BEGIN NOW Other
chap. END
BEGIN NOW --You are the only contributor to DANA who asks for pieces of silver. END
BEGIN NOW Then
I don't know about the next number. END
BEGIN NOW Fred Ryan wants space for an article
on economics. END
BEGIN NOW Fraidrine. END
BEGIN NOW Two pieces of silver he lent me. END
BEGIN NOW Tide you over. END
BEGIN NOW Economics. END
BEGIN NOW --For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and
then gravely said, honeying malice:

--I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper
Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the SUMMA CONTRA
GENTILES in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie,
the coalquay whore. END
BEGIN NOW He broke away. END
BEGIN NOW --Come, Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW Come, wandering Aengus of the birds. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW You have eaten all we left. END
BEGIN NOW Ay. END
BEGIN NOW I will serve you your orts
and offals. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen rose. END
BEGIN NOW Life is many days. END
BEGIN NOW This will end. END
BEGIN NOW --We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. END
BEGIN NOW NOTRE AMI Moore says
Malachi Mulligan must be there. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama. END
BEGIN NOW --Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of
Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be there. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. END
BEGIN NOW Can you walk
straight? END
BEGIN NOW Laughing, he ...

Swill till eleven. END
BEGIN NOW Irish nights entertainment. END
BEGIN NOW Lubber ...

Stephen followed a lubber ...

One day in the national library we had a discussion. END
BEGIN NOW Shakes. END
BEGIN NOW After. END
BEGIN NOW His lub back: I followed. END
BEGIN NOW I gall his kibe. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a
wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering
daylight of no thought. END
BEGIN NOW What have I learned? END
BEGIN NOW Of them? END
BEGIN NOW Of me? END
BEGIN NOW Walk like Haines now. END
BEGIN NOW The constant readers' room. END
BEGIN NOW In the readers' book Cashel Boyle
O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. END
BEGIN NOW Item: was
Hamlet mad? END
BEGIN NOW The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk. END
BEGIN NOW --O please do, sir ... END
BEGIN NOW I shall be most pleased ... END
BEGIN NOW Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:

--A pleased bottom. END
BEGIN NOW The turnstile. END
BEGIN NOW Is that? END
BEGIN NOW ... Blueribboned hat ... Idly writing ... What? END
BEGIN NOW Looked? END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius. END
BEGIN NOW Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:


    JOHN EGLINTON, MY JO, JOHN,
    WHY WON'T YOU WED A WIFE? END
BEGIN NOW He spluttered to the air:

--O, the chinless Chinaman! END
BEGIN NOW Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. END
BEGIN NOW We went over to their
playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. END
BEGIN NOW Our players are creating a new
art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. END
BEGIN NOW Abbey Theatre! END
BEGIN NOW I smell
the pubic sweat of monks. END
BEGIN NOW He spat blank. END
BEGIN NOW Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. END
BEGIN NOW And left the FEMME DE TRENTE ANS. END
BEGIN NOW And why no other children born? END
BEGIN NOW And his
first child a girl? END
BEGIN NOW Afterwit. END
BEGIN NOW Go back. END
BEGIN NOW The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,
minion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair. END
BEGIN NOW Eh ... END
BEGIN NOW I just eh ... wanted ... END
BEGIN NOW I forgot ... he ...

--Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there ...

Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:

    I HARDLY HEAR THE PURLIEU CRY
    OR A TOMMY TALK AS I PASS ONE BY
    BEFORE MY THOUGHTS BEGIN TO RUN
    ON F. M'CURDY ATKINSON,
    THE SAME THAT HAD THE WOODEN LEG
    AND THAT FILIBUSTERING FILIBEG
    THAT NEVER DARED TO SLAKE HIS DROUTH,
    MAGEE THAT HAD THE CHINLESS MOUTH. END
BEGIN NOW BEING AFRAID TO MARRY ON EARTH
    THEY MASTURBATED FOR ALL THEY WERE WORTH. END
BEGIN NOW Jest on. END
BEGIN NOW Know thyself. END
BEGIN NOW Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. END
BEGIN NOW I halt. END
BEGIN NOW --Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. END
BEGIN NOW Synge has left off wearing
black to be like nature. END
BEGIN NOW Only crows, priests and English coal are black. END
BEGIN NOW A laugh tripped over his lips. END
BEGIN NOW --Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old
hake Gregory. END
BEGIN NOW O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! END
BEGIN NOW She gets you a job on
the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't you do
the Yeats touch? END
BEGIN NOW He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:

--The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time. END
BEGIN NOW One thinks of Homer. END
BEGIN NOW He stopped at the stairfoot. END
BEGIN NOW --I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly. END
BEGIN NOW The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. END
BEGIN NOW Gone the nine men's
morrice with caps of indices. END
BEGIN NOW In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:


        EVERYMAN HIS OWN WIFE
                OR
        A HONEYMOON IN THE HAND
    (A NATIONAL IMMORALITY IN THREE ORGASMS)
                BY
        BALLOCKY MULLIGAN


He turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:

--The disguise, I fear, is thin. END
BEGIN NOW But listen. END
BEGIN NOW He read, MARCATO:

--Characters:


    TODY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)
    CRAB (a bushranger)
    MEDICAL DICK  )
        and       ) (two birds with one stone)
    MEDICAL DAVY  )
    MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)
    FRESH NELLY
        and
    ROSALIE (the coalquay whore). END
BEGIN NOW He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:

--O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift
their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,
multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! END
BEGIN NOW --The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted
them. END
BEGIN NOW About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside. END
BEGIN NOW Part. END
BEGIN NOW The moment is now. END
BEGIN NOW Where then? END
BEGIN NOW If Socrates leave his house
today, if Judas go forth tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW That lies in space which I in time
must come to, ineluctably. END
BEGIN NOW My will: his will that fronts me. END
BEGIN NOW Seas between. END
BEGIN NOW A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting. END
BEGIN NOW --Good day again, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW The portico. END
BEGIN NOW Here I watched the birds for augury. END
BEGIN NOW Aengus of the birds. END
BEGIN NOW They go,
they come. END
BEGIN NOW Last night I flew. END
BEGIN NOW Easily flew. END
BEGIN NOW Men wondered. END
BEGIN NOW Street of harlots
after. END
BEGIN NOW A creamfruit melon he held to me. END
BEGIN NOW In. END
BEGIN NOW You will see. END
BEGIN NOW --The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. END
BEGIN NOW Did you
see his eye? END
BEGIN NOW He looked upon you to lust after you. END
BEGIN NOW I fear thee, ancient
mariner. END
BEGIN NOW O, Kinch, thou art in peril. END
BEGIN NOW Get thee a breechpad. END
BEGIN NOW Manner of Oxenford. END
BEGIN NOW Day. END
BEGIN NOW Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge. END
BEGIN NOW A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the
gateway, under portcullis barbs. END
BEGIN NOW They followed. END
BEGIN NOW Offend me still. END
BEGIN NOW Speak on. END
BEGIN NOW Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. END
BEGIN NOW No birds. END
BEGIN NOW Frail
from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw
of softness softly were blown. END
BEGIN NOW Cease to strive. END
BEGIN NOW Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:

The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. END
BEGIN NOW reset his smooth
watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. END
BEGIN NOW Five to
three. END
BEGIN NOW Just nice time to walk to Artane. END
BEGIN NOW What was that boy's name again? END
BEGIN NOW Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW VERE DIGNUM ET IUSTUM EST. END
BEGIN NOW Brother Swan was the person to
see. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Cunningham's letter. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Oblige him, if possible. END
BEGIN NOW Good practical
catholic: useful at mission time. END
BEGIN NOW A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his
crutches, growled some notes. END
BEGIN NOW He jerked short before the convent of the
sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very
reverend John Conmee S. J. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his
purse held, he knew, one silver crown. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. END
BEGIN NOW He thought, but not for
long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by
cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal
Wolsey's words: IF I HAD SERVED MY GOD AS I HAVE SERVED MY KING HE WOULD
NOT HAVE ABANDONED ME IN MY OLD DAYS. END
BEGIN NOW He walked by the treeshade of
sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy
M.P. END
BEGIN NOW --Very well, indeed, father. END
BEGIN NOW And you, father? END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. END
BEGIN NOW He would go to Buxton
probably for the waters. END
BEGIN NOW And her boys, were they getting on well at
Belvedere? END
BEGIN NOW Was that so? END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. END
BEGIN NOW And Mr Sheehy himself? END
BEGIN NOW Still in London. END
BEGIN NOW The house was still sitting, to be
sure it was. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it was very
probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. END
BEGIN NOW O,
yes: a very great success. END
BEGIN NOW A wonderful man really. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy
M.P. END
BEGIN NOW Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy
M.P. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he would certainly call. END
BEGIN NOW --Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW And smiled yet again, in
going. END
BEGIN NOW He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice. END
BEGIN NOW --Pilate! END
BEGIN NOW Wy don't you old back that owlin mob? END
BEGIN NOW A zealous man, however. END
BEGIN NOW Really he was. END
BEGIN NOW And really did great good in. END
BEGIN NOW his way. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond a doubt. END
BEGIN NOW He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the
Irish. END
BEGIN NOW Of good family too would one think it? END
BEGIN NOW Welsh, were they not? END
BEGIN NOW O, lest he forget. END
BEGIN NOW That letter to father provincial. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of
Mountjoy square. END
BEGIN NOW Yes: they were from Belvedere. END
BEGIN NOW The little house. END
BEGIN NOW Aha. END
BEGIN NOW And were they good boys at school? END
BEGIN NOW O. END
BEGIN NOW That was very good now. END
BEGIN NOW And what
was his name? END
BEGIN NOW Jack Sohan. END
BEGIN NOW And his name? END
BEGIN NOW Ger. END
BEGIN NOW Gallaher. END
BEGIN NOW And the other
little man? END
BEGIN NOW His name was Brunny Lynam. END
BEGIN NOW O, that was a very nice name to
have. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam
and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street. END
BEGIN NOW --But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said. END
BEGIN NOW The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:

--O, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said. END
BEGIN NOW Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's
letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy
square east. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate
frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers,
canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment
most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the
corner of Dignam's court. END
BEGIN NOW Was that not Mrs M'Guinness? END
BEGIN NOW Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from
the farther footpath along which she sailed. END
BEGIN NOW And Father Conmee smiled and
saluted. END
BEGIN NOW How did she do? END
BEGIN NOW A fine carriage she had. END
BEGIN NOW Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. END
BEGIN NOW And to
think that she was a pawnbroker! END
BEGIN NOW Well, now! END
BEGIN NOW Such a ... what should he
say? END
BEGIN NOW ... such a queenly mien. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the
shutup free church on his left. END
BEGIN NOW The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. END
BEGIN NOW will (D.V.) END
BEGIN NOW speak. END
BEGIN NOW The incumbent they called him. END
BEGIN NOW He felt it incumbent on him to say a
few words. END
BEGIN NOW But one should be charitable. END
BEGIN NOW Invincible ignorance. END
BEGIN NOW They acted
according to their lights. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North
Circular road. END
BEGIN NOW It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an
important thoroughfare. END
BEGIN NOW Surely, there ought to be. END
BEGIN NOW A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. END
BEGIN NOW All
raised untidy caps. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. END
BEGIN NOW Christian brother boys. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. END
BEGIN NOW Saint
Joseph's church, Portland row. END
BEGIN NOW For aged and virtuous females. END
BEGIN NOW Father
Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. END
BEGIN NOW Virtuous: but occasionally
they were also badtempered. END
BEGIN NOW Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
nobleman. END
BEGIN NOW And now it was an office or something. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was
saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours
that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. END
BEGIN NOW He passed
Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a
dreadful catastrophe in New York. END
BEGIN NOW In America those things were
continually happening. END
BEGIN NOW Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. END
BEGIN NOW Still, an act of perfect contrition. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the
window of which two unlabouring men lounged. END
BEGIN NOW They saluted him and
were saluted. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where
Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of
hay. END
BEGIN NOW A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee
saluted the constable. END
BEGIN NOW In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee
observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
tubes. END
BEGIN NOW Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a
turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
him. END
BEGIN NOW It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the
Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and
bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people. END
BEGIN NOW On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. END
BEGIN NOW of saint
Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward
bound tram. END
BEGIN NOW Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley
C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen
bridge. END
BEGIN NOW At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound
tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked
with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a
sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his
purse. END
BEGIN NOW Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector
usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. END
BEGIN NOW The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee
excessive for a journey so short and cheap. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee liked cheerful
decorum. END
BEGIN NOW It was a peaceful day. END
BEGIN NOW The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. END
BEGIN NOW His wife, Father
Conmee supposed. END
BEGIN NOW A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman
with the glasses. END
BEGIN NOW She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently,
tiptapping  her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily,
sweetly. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. END
BEGIN NOW He perceived also
that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of
the seat. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head. END
BEGIN NOW At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an
old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. END
BEGIN NOW The conductor pulled
the bellstrap to stay the car for her. END
BEGIN NOW She passed out with her basket and
a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always
to be told twice BLESS YOU, MY CHILD, that they have been absolved, PRAY
FOR ME. END
BEGIN NOW But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor
creatures. END
BEGIN NOW From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
Father Conmee. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow
men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. END
BEGIN NOW and the African mission
and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown
and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last
hour came like a thief in the night. END
BEGIN NOW That book by the Belgian jesuit, LE
NOMBRE DES ELUS, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. END
BEGIN NOW Those were
millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the
faith had not (D.V.) END
BEGIN NOW been brought. END
BEGIN NOW But they were God's souls, created by
God. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a
waste, if one might say. END
BEGIN NOW At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
conductor and saluted in his turn. END
BEGIN NOW The Malahide road was quiet. END
BEGIN NOW It pleased Father Conmee, road and
name. END
BEGIN NOW The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Talbot de Malahide,
immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. END
BEGIN NOW Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. END
BEGIN NOW Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times
in the barony. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book OLD TIMES IN THE
BARONY and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of
Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere. END
BEGIN NOW A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough
Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the
evening, not startled when an otter plunged. END
BEGIN NOW Who could know the truth? END
BEGIN NOW Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not
committed adultery fully, EIACULATIO SEMINIS INTER VAS NATURALE MULIERIS,
with her husband's brother? END
BEGIN NOW She would half confess if she had not all
sinned as women did. END
BEGIN NOW Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed
however for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not
our ways. END
BEGIN NOW Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. END
BEGIN NOW He was
humane and honoured there. END
BEGIN NOW He bore in mind secrets confessed and he
smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full
fruit clusters. END
BEGIN NOW And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to
noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee. END
BEGIN NOW It was a charming day. END
BEGIN NOW The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
curtseying to him with ample underleaves. END
BEGIN NOW The sky showed him a flock of
small white clouds going slowly down the wind. END
BEGIN NOW MOUTONNER, the French
said. END
BEGIN NOW A just and homely word. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning
clouds over Rathcoffey. END
BEGIN NOW His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble
of Clongowes field. END
BEGIN NOW He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the
cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. END
BEGIN NOW He was their rector: his reign was mild. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. END
BEGIN NOW An ivory bookmark told him the page. END
BEGIN NOW Nones. END
BEGIN NOW He should have read that before lunch. END
BEGIN NOW But lady Maxwell had come. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee read in secret PATER and AVE and crossed his breast. END
BEGIN NOW DEUS IN ADIUTORIUM. END
BEGIN NOW He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till
he came to RES in BEATI IMMACULATI: PRINCIPIUM VERBORUM TUORUM VERITAS:
IN ETERNUM OMNIA INDICIA IUSTITIAE TUAE. END
BEGIN NOW A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came
a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. END
BEGIN NOW The young man
raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
detached from her light skirt a clinging twig. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
breviary. END
BEGIN NOW SIN: PRINCIPES PERSECUTI SUNT ME GRATIS: ET A VERBIS TUIS

Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his
drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. END
BEGIN NOW He pulled himself
erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
furnishings. END
BEGIN NOW Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to
the doorway. END

leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out. END

Newcomen bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
downtilted, chewing his blade of hay. END
BEGIN NOW Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day. END
BEGIN NOW --That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, Corny Kelleher said. END
BEGIN NOW --It's very close, the constable said. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a
coin. END
BEGIN NOW --What's the best news? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW --I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated
breath. END

A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner,
skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. END
BEGIN NOW Towards Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled
unamiably:

--FOR ENGLAND ... END
BEGIN NOW He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus,
halted and growled:

--HOME AND BEAUTY. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was
in the warehouse with a visitor. END
BEGIN NOW A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped
it into the cap held out to her. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced
sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward
four strides. END
BEGIN NOW He halted and growled angrily:

--FOR ENGLAND ...

Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,
gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths. END
BEGIN NOW He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
towards a window and bayed deeply:

--HOME AND BEAUTY. END
BEGIN NOW The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. END
BEGIN NOW The blind of the window was drawn aside. END
BEGIN NOW A card UNFURNISHED APARTMENTS
slipped from the sash and fell. END
BEGIN NOW A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen,
held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. END
BEGIN NOW A woman's
hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. END
BEGIN NOW It fell on the path. END
BEGIN NOW One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
minstrel's cap, saying:

--There, sir. END

Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming
kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW --Did you put in the books? END
BEGIN NOW Boody asked. END
BEGIN NOW Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling
suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow. END
BEGIN NOW --They wouldn't give anything on them, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked
ankles tickled by stubble. END
BEGIN NOW --Where did you try? END
BEGIN NOW Boody asked. END
BEGIN NOW --M'Guinness's. END
BEGIN NOW Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table. END
BEGIN NOW --Bad cess to her big face! END
BEGIN NOW she cried. END
BEGIN NOW Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --What's in the pot? END
BEGIN NOW she asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Shirts, Maggy said. END
BEGIN NOW Boody cried angrily:

--Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat? END
BEGIN NOW Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:

--And what's in this? END
BEGIN NOW A heavy fume gushed in answer. END
BEGIN NOW --Peasoup, Maggy said. END
BEGIN NOW --Where did you get it? END
BEGIN NOW Katey asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey rang his bell. END
BEGIN NOW --Barang! END
BEGIN NOW Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:

--Give us it here. END
BEGIN NOW Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. END
BEGIN NOW Katey,
sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth
random crumbs:

--A good job we have that much. END
BEGIN NOW Where's Dilly? END
BEGIN NOW --Gone to meet father, Maggy said. END
BEGIN NOW Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:

--Our father who art not in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:

--Boody! END
BEGIN NOW For shame! END
BEGIN NOW A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down
the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed
around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,
between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay. END

The blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling
fibre. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper
and a small jar. END
BEGIN NOW --Put these in first, will you? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir, the blond girl said. END
BEGIN NOW And the fruit on top. END
BEGIN NOW --That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said. END
BEGIN NOW She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe
shamefaced peaches. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the
fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red
tomatoes, sniffing smells. END
BEGIN NOW H. E. L. END
BEGIN NOW Y. END

plodding towards their goal. END

from his fob and held it at its chain's length. END
BEGIN NOW --Can you send them by tram? END
BEGIN NOW Now? END
BEGIN NOW A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the
hawker's cart. END
BEGIN NOW --Certainly, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Is it in the city? END
BEGIN NOW --O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. END
BEGIN NOW Ten minutes. END
BEGIN NOW The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil. END
BEGIN NOW --Will you write the address, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her. END
BEGIN NOW --Send it at once, will you? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW It's for an invalid. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I will, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket. END
BEGIN NOW --What's the damage? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. END
BEGIN NOW A young pullet. END

took a red carnation from the tall stemglass. END
BEGIN NOW --This for me? END
BEGIN NOW he asked gallantly. END
BEGIN NOW The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie
a bit crooked, blushing. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the
red flower between his smiling teeth. END
BEGIN NOW --May I say a word to your telephone, missy? END
BEGIN NOW he asked roguishly. END

gripping the handrests. END

of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed. END

Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of THE WOMAN IN WHITE
far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her
typewriter. END
BEGIN NOW Too much mystery business in it. END
BEGIN NOW Is he in love with that one, Marion? END
BEGIN NOW Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye. END
BEGIN NOW The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled
them: six. END

the slab where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning

Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch. END
BEGIN NOW --Who's that? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert asked. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Crotty? END
BEGIN NOW --Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold. END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, Jack, is that yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his
pliant lath among the flickering arches. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Mind your steps there. END
BEGIN NOW The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft
flame and was let fall. END
BEGIN NOW At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air
closed round them. END
BEGIN NOW --How interesting! END
BEGIN NOW a refined accent said in the gloom. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. END
BEGIN NOW We are standing in the historic
council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed
himself a rebel in 1534. END
BEGIN NOW This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. END
BEGIN NOW The
old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the
original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over
in Adelaide road. END
BEGIN NOW You were never here before, Jack, were you? END
BEGIN NOW --No, Ned. END
BEGIN NOW --He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my
memory serves me. END
BEGIN NOW The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court. END
BEGIN NOW --That's right, Ned Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW That's quite right, sir. END
BEGIN NOW --If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow
me perhaps ...

--Certainly, Ned Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW Bring the camera whenever you like. END
BEGIN NOW I'll
get those bags cleared away from the windows. END
BEGIN NOW You can take it from here or
from here. END
BEGIN NOW In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled
seedbags and points of vantage on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. END
BEGIN NOW I won't trespass on
your valuable time ...

week, say. END
BEGIN NOW Can you see? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. END

among the pillars. END

abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut
meal, O'Connor, Wexford. END

BEGIN NOW --God! END
BEGIN NOW he cried. END
BEGIN NOW I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare
after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. END
BEGIN NOW You know that one? END
BEGIN NOW I'M BLOODY SORRY
I DID IT, says he, BUT I DECLARE TO GOD I THOUGHT THE ARCHBISHOP WAS

BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW God, I'll tell him anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. END

slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:

BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW Say it's turn six. END
BEGIN NOW In here, see. END
BEGIN NOW Turn Now On. END
BEGIN NOW He slid it into the left slot for them. END
BEGIN NOW It shot down the groove, wobbled
a while, ceased, ogling them: six. END
BEGIN NOW Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the
consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying
the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the
admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly
female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of
great amplitude. END
BEGIN NOW --See? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. END
BEGIN NOW The impact. END
BEGIN NOW Leverage, see? END
BEGIN NOW He showed them the rising column of disks on the right. END
BEGIN NOW --Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. END
BEGIN NOW So a fellow coming in late can
see what turn is on and what turns are over. END
BEGIN NOW --See? END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford said. END
BEGIN NOW He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop:
four. END
BEGIN NOW Turn Now On. END
BEGIN NOW --I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. END
BEGIN NOW One good
turn deserves another. END
BEGIN NOW --Do, Tom Rochford said. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience. END
BEGIN NOW --Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. END
BEGIN NOW When you two begin

Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it. END
BEGIN NOW --But how does it work here, Tommy? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Tooraloo, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW See you later. END

BEGIN NOW --He's a hero, he said simply. END
BEGIN NOW --I know, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW The drain, you mean. END
BEGIN NOW --Drain? END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW It was down a manhole. END
BEGIN NOW They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming
soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile. END
BEGIN NOW Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall
Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. END
BEGIN NOW One of those manholes
like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half
choked with sewer gas. END
BEGIN NOW Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest
and all, with the rope round him. END
BEGIN NOW And be damned but he got the rope round
the poor devil and the two were hauled up. END
BEGIN NOW --The act of a hero, he said. END
BEGIN NOW At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past
them for Jervis street. END
BEGIN NOW --This way, he said, walking to the right. END
BEGIN NOW I want to pop into Lynam's to
see Sceptre's starting price. END
BEGIN NOW What's the time by your gold watch and
chain? END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at
O'Neill's clock. END
BEGIN NOW --After three, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Who's riding her? END
BEGIN NOW --O. Madden, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW And a game filly she is. END
BEGIN NOW While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with
gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow might damn
easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal
cavalcade. END
BEGIN NOW --Even money, Lenehan said returning. END
BEGIN NOW I knocked against Bantam Lyons in
there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an
earthly. END
BEGIN NOW Through here. END
BEGIN NOW They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. END
BEGIN NOW A darkbacked
figure scanned books on the hawker's cart. END
BEGIN NOW --There he is, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW --Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind. END
BEGIN NOW --LEOPOLDO OR THE BLOOM IS ON THE RYE, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW --He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW I was with him one day and he
bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. END
BEGIN NOW There were
fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
comets with long tails. END
BEGIN NOW Astronomy it was about. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan laughed. END
BEGIN NOW --I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Come over in
the sun. END
BEGIN NOW They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by
the riverwall. END
BEGIN NOW Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late
Fehrenbach's, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks. END
BEGIN NOW --There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said

was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson
spoke and there was music. END
BEGIN NOW Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard ...

--I know, M'Coy broke in. END
BEGIN NOW My missus sang there once. END
BEGIN NOW --Did she? END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW A card UNFURNISHED APARTMENTS reappeared on the windowsash of
number 7 Eccles street. END
BEGIN NOW He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh. END
BEGIN NOW --But wait till I tell you, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Delahunt of Camden street had the
catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom and the wife were
there. END
BEGIN NOW Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to
which we did ample justice. END
BEGIN NOW Fast and furious it was. END
BEGIN NOW After liquids came
solids. END
BEGIN NOW Cold joints galore and mince pies ...

--I know, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW The year the missus was there ...

Lenehan linked his arm warmly. END
BEGIN NOW --But wait till I tell you, he said. END
BEGIN NOW We had a midnight lunch too after all
the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the
morning after the night before. END
BEGIN NOW Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's
night on the Featherbed Mountain. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. END
BEGIN NOW We started singing
glees and duets: LO, THE EARLY BEAM OF MORNING. END
BEGIN NOW She was well primed with a
good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. END
BEGIN NOW Every jolt the bloody
car gave I had her bumping up against me. END
BEGIN NOW Hell's delights! END
BEGIN NOW She has a fine
pair, God bless her. END
BEGIN NOW Like that. END
BEGIN NOW He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:

--I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Know
what I mean? END
BEGIN NOW His hands moulded ample curves of air. END
BEGIN NOW He shut his eyes tight in
delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips. END
BEGIN NOW --The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW She's a gamey
mare and no mistake. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets
in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and
Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. END
BEGIN NOW But, by God, I was
lost, so to speak, in the milky way. END
BEGIN NOW He knows them all, faith. END
BEGIN NOW At last she
spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. END
BEGIN NOW AND WHAT STAR IS THAT, POLDY? END
BEGIN NOW says
she. END
BEGIN NOW By God, she had Bloom cornered. END
BEGIN NOW THAT ONE, IS IT? END
BEGIN NOW says Chris Callinan,
SURE THAT'S ONLY WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A PINPRICK. END
BEGIN NOW By God, he wasn't far
wide of the mark. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft
laughter. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm weak, he gasped. END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan walked on again. END
BEGIN NOW He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his
hindhead rapidly. END
BEGIN NOW He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW --He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. END
BEGIN NOW He's not one
of your common or garden ... you know ... END
BEGIN NOW There's a touch of the artist
about old Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW * * * * *


Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of THE AWFUL DISCLOSURES OF MARIA
MONK, then of Aristotle's MASTERPIECE. END
BEGIN NOW Crooked botched print. END
BEGIN NOW Plates:
infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered
cows. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. END
BEGIN NOW All
butting with their skulls to get out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Child born every minute
somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Purefoy. END
BEGIN NOW He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: TALES OF THE GHETTO
by Leopold von Sacher Masoch. END
BEGIN NOW --That I had, he said, pushing it by. END
BEGIN NOW The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter. END
BEGIN NOW --Them are two good ones, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined
mouth. END
BEGIN NOW He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against
his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain. END
BEGIN NOW On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment
and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.

Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. END
BEGIN NOW FAIR TYRANTS by James Lovebirch. END
BEGIN NOW Know the kind that is. END
BEGIN NOW Had it? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW He opened it. END
BEGIN NOW Thought so. END
BEGIN NOW A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. END
BEGIN NOW Listen: the man. END
BEGIN NOW No: she wouldn't like that much. END
BEGIN NOW Got her it once. END
BEGIN NOW He read the other title: SWEETS OF SIN. END
BEGIN NOW More in her line. END
BEGIN NOW Let us see. END
BEGIN NOW He read where his finger opened. END
BEGIN NOW --ALL THE DOLLARBILLS HER HUSBAND GAVE HER WERE SPENT IN THE STORES ON
WONDROUS GOWNS AND COSTLIEST FRILLIES. END
BEGIN NOW FOR HIM! END
BEGIN NOW FOR RAOUL! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW This. END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW Try. END
BEGIN NOW --HER MOUTH GLUED ON HIS IN A LUSCIOUS VOLUPTUOUS KISS WHILE HIS HANDS
FELT FOR THE OPULENT CURVES INSIDE HER DESHABILLE. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Take this. END
BEGIN NOW The end. END
BEGIN NOW --YOU ARE LATE, HE SPOKE HOARSELY, EYING HER WITH A SUSPICIOUS GLARE. END
BEGIN NOW THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THREW OFF HER SABLETRIMMED WRAP, DISPLAYING HER
QUEENLY SHOULDERS AND HEAVING EMBONPOINT. END
BEGIN NOW AN IMPERCEPTIBLE SMILE PLAYED
ROUND HER PERFECT LIPS AS SHE TURNED TO HIM CALMLY. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom read again: THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. END
BEGIN NOW Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. END
BEGIN NOW Flesh yielded
amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. END
BEGIN NOW His nostrils
arched themselves for prey. END
BEGIN NOW Melting breast ointments (FOR HIM! END
BEGIN NOW FOR
RAOUL!). END
BEGIN NOW Armpits' oniony sweat. END
BEGIN NOW Fishgluey slime (HER HEAVING EMBONPOINT!). END
BEGIN NOW Feel! END
BEGIN NOW Press! END

BEGIN NOW Sulphur dung of lions! END
BEGIN NOW Young! END
BEGIN NOW Young! END
BEGIN NOW An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of
chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the
lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty
division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns
versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation
of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee
Corporation. END
BEGIN NOW Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
curtains. END
BEGIN NOW The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
reddened face, coughing. END
BEGIN NOW He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the
floor. END
BEGIN NOW He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and
bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom beheld it. END
BEGIN NOW Mastering his troubled breath, he said:

--I'll take this one. END
BEGIN NOW The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum. END
BEGIN NOW --SWEETS OF SIN, he said, tapping on it. END
BEGIN NOW That's a good one. END
BEGIN NOW * * * * *


The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell
twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet. END
BEGIN NOW Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,
the cries of the auctioneer within. END
BEGIN NOW Four and nine. END
BEGIN NOW Those lovely curtains. END
BEGIN NOW Five shillings. END
BEGIN NOW Cosy curtains. END
BEGIN NOW Selling new at two guineas. END
BEGIN NOW Any advance on
five shillings? END
BEGIN NOW Going for five shillings. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:

--Barang! END
BEGIN NOW Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched
necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's
row. END
BEGIN NOW He halted near his daughter. END
BEGIN NOW --It's time for you, she said. END
BEGIN NOW --Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Are
you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon
shoulder? END
BEGIN NOW Melancholy God! END
BEGIN NOW Dilly shrugged her shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them
and held them back. END
BEGIN NOW --Stand up straight, girl, he said. END
BEGIN NOW You'll get curvature of the spine. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what you look like? END
BEGIN NOW He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his
shoulders and dropping his underjaw. END
BEGIN NOW --Give it up, father, Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW All the people are looking at you. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache. END
BEGIN NOW --Did you get any money? END
BEGIN NOW Dilly asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Where would I get money? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW There is no-one in Dublin
would lend me fourpence. END
BEGIN NOW --You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --How do you know that? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly
along James's street. END
BEGIN NOW --I know you did, Dilly answered. END
BEGIN NOW Were you in the Scotch house now? END
BEGIN NOW --I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Was it the little nuns
taught you to be so saucy? END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW He handed her a shilling. END
BEGIN NOW --See if you can do anything with that, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --I suppose you got five, Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW Give me more than that. END
BEGIN NOW --Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. END
BEGIN NOW You're like the rest of
them, are you? END
BEGIN NOW An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother
died. END
BEGIN NOW But wait awhile. END
BEGIN NOW You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from
me. END
BEGIN NOW Low blackguardism! END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to get rid of you. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't care if I
was stretched out stiff. END
BEGIN NOW He's dead. END
BEGIN NOW The man upstairs is dead. END
BEGIN NOW He left her and walked on. END
BEGIN NOW Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, what is it? END
BEGIN NOW he said, stopping. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs. END
BEGIN NOW --Barang! END
BEGIN NOW --Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell
but feebly:

--Bang! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus stared at him. END
BEGIN NOW --Watch him, he said. END
BEGIN NOW It's instructive. END
BEGIN NOW I wonder will he allow us to talk. END
BEGIN NOW --You got more than that, father, Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you
all where Jesus left the jews. END
BEGIN NOW Look, there's all I have. END
BEGIN NOW I got two
shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the
funeral. END
BEGIN NOW He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously. END
BEGIN NOW --Can't you look for some money somewhere? END
BEGIN NOW Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus thought and nodded. END
BEGIN NOW --I will, he said gravely. END
BEGIN NOW I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell
street. END
BEGIN NOW I'll try this one now. END
BEGIN NOW --You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning. END
BEGIN NOW --Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. END
BEGIN NOW Get a glass of milk for
yourself and a bun or a something. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be home shortly. END
BEGIN NOW He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on. END
BEGIN NOW The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out
of Parkgate. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey banged loudly. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a
pursing mincing mouth gently:

--The little nuns! END
BEGIN NOW Nice little things! END
BEGIN NOW O, sure they wouldn't do anything! END
BEGIN NOW O, sure they wouldn't really! END
BEGIN NOW Is it little sister Monica! END
BEGIN NOW * * * * *


From the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the
order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street,
past Shackleton's offices. END
BEGIN NOW Got round him all right. END
BEGIN NOW How do you do, Mr
Crimmins? END
BEGIN NOW First rate, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I was afraid you might be up in your other
establishment in Pimlico. END
BEGIN NOW How are things going? END
BEGIN NOW Just keeping alive. END
BEGIN NOW Lovely weather we're having. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Good for the country. END
BEGIN NOW Those
farmers are always grumbling. END
BEGIN NOW I'll just take a thimbleful of your best
gin, Mr Crimmins. END
BEGIN NOW A small gin, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible affair that
General Slocum explosion. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible, terrible! END
BEGIN NOW A thousand casualties. END
BEGIN NOW And
heartrending scenes. END
BEGIN NOW Men trampling down women and children. END
BEGIN NOW Most brutal
thing. END
BEGIN NOW What do they say was the cause? END
BEGIN NOW Spontaneous combustion. END
BEGIN NOW Most
scandalous revelation. END
BEGIN NOW Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose
all burst. END
BEGIN NOW What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a
boat like that ... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. END
BEGIN NOW You know
why? END
BEGIN NOW Palm oil. END
BEGIN NOW Is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW Without a doubt. END
BEGIN NOW Well now, look at that. END
BEGIN NOW And America they say is the land of the free. END
BEGIN NOW I thought we were bad here. END
BEGIN NOW I smiled at him. END
BEGIN NOW AMERICA, I said quietly, just like that. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT IS IT? END
BEGIN NOW THE
SWEEPINGS OF EVERY COUNTRY INCLUDING OUR OWN. END
BEGIN NOW ISN'T THAT TRUE? END
BEGIN NOW That's a
fact. END
BEGIN NOW Graft, my dear sir. END
BEGIN NOW Well, of course, where there's money going there's
always someone to pick it up. END
BEGIN NOW Saw him looking at my frockcoat. END
BEGIN NOW Dress does it. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing like a dressy
appearance. END
BEGIN NOW Bowls them over. END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW How are things? END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter
Kennedy, hairdresser. END
BEGIN NOW Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. END
BEGIN NOW Scott of Dawson
street. END
BEGIN NOW Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. END
BEGIN NOW Never built
under three guineas. END
BEGIN NOW Fits me down to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Some Kildare street club
toff had it probably. END
BEGIN NOW John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank,
gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered
me. END
BEGIN NOW Aham! END
BEGIN NOW Must dress the character for those fellows. END
BEGIN NOW Knight of the road. END
BEGIN NOW Gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom
again, sir. END
BEGIN NOW The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has
it. END
BEGIN NOW North wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains,
sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the
ferrywash, Elijah is coming. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. END
BEGIN NOW High colour, of course. END
BEGIN NOW Grizzled moustache. END
BEGIN NOW Returned Indian officer. END
BEGIN NOW Bravely he bore his stumpy
body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Ned
Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW He's as like it as damn
it. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. END
BEGIN NOW Just a flash
like that. END
BEGIN NOW Damn like him. END
BEGIN NOW Aham! END
BEGIN NOW Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. END
BEGIN NOW Good
drop of gin, that was. END
BEGIN NOW His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his
fat strut. END
BEGIN NOW Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. END
BEGIN NOW Greasy black rope. END
BEGIN NOW Dogs
licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife drove by
in her noddy. END
BEGIN NOW Bad times those were. END
BEGIN NOW Well, well. END
BEGIN NOW Over and done with. END
BEGIN NOW Great topers too. END
BEGIN NOW Fourbottle men. END
BEGIN NOW Let me see. END
BEGIN NOW Is he buried in saint Michan's? END
BEGIN NOW Or no, there was a midnight
burial in Glasnevin. END
BEGIN NOW Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. END
BEGIN NOW Dignam is there now. END
BEGIN NOW Went out in a puff. END
BEGIN NOW Well, well. END
BEGIN NOW Better turn down
here. END
BEGIN NOW Make a detour. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the
corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. END
BEGIN NOW Outside the Dublin Distillers
Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins
knotted to the wheel. END
BEGIN NOW Damn dangerous thing. END
BEGIN NOW Some Tipperary bosthoon
endangering the lives of the citizens. END
BEGIN NOW Runaway horse. END
BEGIN NOW Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry
Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office
of Messrs Collis and Ward. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan approached Island street. END
BEGIN NOW Times of the troubles. END
BEGIN NOW Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those
reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. END
BEGIN NOW When you look back on it all now
in a kind of retrospective arrangement. END
BEGIN NOW Gaming at Daly's. END
BEGIN NOW No cardsharping
then. END
BEGIN NOW One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. END
BEGIN NOW Stables
behind Moira house. END
BEGIN NOW Damn good gin that was. END
BEGIN NOW Fine dashing young nobleman. END
BEGIN NOW Good stock, of course. END
BEGIN NOW That ruffian, that
sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. END
BEGIN NOW Course they were on
the wrong side. END
BEGIN NOW They rose in dark and evil days. END

Ingram. END
BEGIN NOW They were gentlemen. END

touchingly. END

BEGIN NOW A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,
leaping in their, in their saddles. END
BEGIN NOW Frockcoats. END
BEGIN NOW Cream sunshades. END

BEGIN NOW His Excellency! END

darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. END

coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and
winedark stones. END

shining in the darkness. END

standing from everlasting to everlasting. END

Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one
with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled. END

right, sir. END

shoulderblade. END
BEGIN NOW In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing
Sayers held his eye. END

each to other his bulbous fists. END

glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. END

--Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW How are things? END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping. END
BEGIN NOW They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. END
BEGIN NOW Father Cowley
brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand. END
BEGIN NOW --What's the best news? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW --Why then not much, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW I'm barricaded up, Simon, with
two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance. END
BEGIN NOW --Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Who is it? END
BEGIN NOW --O, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW --With a broken back, is it? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW --The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. END
BEGIN NOW Reuben of that ilk. END
BEGIN NOW I'm just
waiting for Ben Dollard. END
BEGIN NOW He's going to say a word to long John to get him
to take those two men off. END
BEGIN NOW All I want is a little time. END
BEGIN NOW He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
his neck. END
BEGIN NOW --I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. END
BEGIN NOW Poor old bockedy Ben! END
BEGIN NOW He's always
doing a good turn for someone. END
BEGIN NOW Hold hard! END
BEGIN NOW He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant. END
BEGIN NOW --There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets. END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed
the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. END
BEGIN NOW He came towards them at an
amble, scratching actively behind his coattails. END
BEGIN NOW As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:

--Hold that fellow with the bad trousers. END
BEGIN NOW --Hold him now, Ben Dollard said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard's
figure. END
BEGIN NOW Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered
sneeringly:

--That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day? END
BEGIN NOW --Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw. END
BEGIN NOW He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from
points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:

--They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW --Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks be to
God he's not paid yet. END
BEGIN NOW --And how is that BASSO PROFONDO, Benjamin? END
BEGIN NOW Father Cowley asked. END
BEGIN NOW Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed,
strode past the Kildare street club. END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a
deep note. END
BEGIN NOW --Aw! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW --That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone. END
BEGIN NOW --What about that? END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard said. END
BEGIN NOW Not too dusty? END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW He turned to both. END
BEGIN NOW --That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also. END
BEGIN NOW The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by
Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of
hurdles. END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
his joyful fingers in the air. END
BEGIN NOW --Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I want to show
you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. END
BEGIN NOW He's a cross between Lobengula
and Lynchehaun. END
BEGIN NOW He's well worth seeing, mind you. END
BEGIN NOW Come along. END
BEGIN NOW I saw John
Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall
if I don't ... END
BEGIN NOW Wait awhile ... We're on the right lay, Bob, believe you
me. END
BEGIN NOW --For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously. END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright. END
BEGIN NOW --What few days? END
BEGIN NOW he boomed. END

BEGIN NOW --Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben
Dollard said. END
BEGIN NOW The landlord has the prior claim. END
BEGIN NOW I gave him all the
particulars. END
BEGIN NOW 29 Windsor avenue. END
BEGIN NOW Love is the name? END
BEGIN NOW --That's right, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW The reverend Mr Love. END
BEGIN NOW He's a minister
in the country somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW But are you sure of that? END
BEGIN NOW --You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that
writ where Jacko put the nuts. END
BEGIN NOW He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk. END
BEGIN NOW --Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his
glasses on his coatfront, following them. END

--The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed
out of the Castleyard gate. END
BEGIN NOW The policeman touched his forehead. END
BEGIN NOW --God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily. END
BEGIN NOW He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
towards Lord Edward street. END
BEGIN NOW Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above
the crossblind of the Ormond hotel. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. END
BEGIN NOW I wrote to Father
Conmee and laid the whole case before him. END
BEGIN NOW --You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward. END
BEGIN NOW --Boyd? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said shortly. END
BEGIN NOW Touch me not. END
BEGIN NOW John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
quickly down Cork hill. END
BEGIN NOW On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending. END
BEGIN NOW The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street. END
BEGIN NOW --Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the MAIL
office. END
BEGIN NOW I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings. END
BEGIN NOW --Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. END
BEGIN NOW And put down the
five shillings too. END
BEGIN NOW --Without a second word either, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW --Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added. END
BEGIN NOW John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly. END
BEGIN NOW They went down Parliament street. END
BEGIN NOW --There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's. END
BEGIN NOW --Righto, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Here goes. END
BEGIN NOW Outside LA MAISON CLAIRE Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's brother-in-
law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties. END
BEGIN NOW John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the
elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches. END
BEGIN NOW --The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse
Nolan told Mr Power. END
BEGIN NOW They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. END
BEGIN NOW The
empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham,
speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
glance. END
BEGIN NOW --And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as
life. END
BEGIN NOW The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood. END
BEGIN NOW --Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
greeted. END
BEGIN NOW Long John Fanning made no way for them. END
BEGIN NOW He removed his large Henry Clay
decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their
faces. END
BEGIN NOW --Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? END
BEGIN NOW he
said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk. END
BEGIN NOW Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
about their damned Irish language. END
BEGIN NOW Where was the marshal, he wanted to
know, to keep order in the council chamber. END
BEGIN NOW And old Barlow the macebearer
laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum
even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan
Sherlock doing LOCUM TENENS for him. END
BEGIN NOW Damned Irish language, language of
our forefathers. END
BEGIN NOW Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the
assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his
peace. END
BEGIN NOW --What Dignam was that? END
BEGIN NOW long John Fanning asked. END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot. END
BEGIN NOW --O, my corns! END
BEGIN NOW he said plaintively. END
BEGIN NOW Come upstairs for goodness' sake till
I sit down somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Uff! END
BEGIN NOW Ooo! END
BEGIN NOW Mind! END
BEGIN NOW Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and
passed in and up the stairs. END
BEGIN NOW --Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think you
knew him or perhaps you did, though. END
BEGIN NOW With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in. END
BEGIN NOW --Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror. END
BEGIN NOW --Rather lowsized. END
BEGIN NOW Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham
said. END
BEGIN NOW Long John Fanning could not remember him. END
BEGIN NOW Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air. END
BEGIN NOW --What's that? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW All turned where they stood. END
BEGIN NOW John Wyse Nolan came down again. END
BEGIN NOW From the
cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,
harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. END
BEGIN NOW Gaily they went past
before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. END
BEGIN NOW In saddles of the leaders,
leaping leaders, rode outriders. END
BEGIN NOW --What was it? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW --The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
Nolan answered from the stairfoot. END

As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind
his Panama to Haines:

--Parnell's brother. END
BEGIN NOW There in the corner. END
BEGIN NOW They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man
whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard. END
BEGIN NOW --Is that he? END
BEGIN NOW Haines asked, twisting round in his seat. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal. END
BEGIN NOW John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey
claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. END
BEGIN NOW An instant after,
under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and
fell once more upon a working corner. END
BEGIN NOW --I'll take a MELANGE, Haines said to the waitress. END
BEGIN NOW --Two MELANGES, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW And bring us some scones and butter
and some cakes as well. END
BEGIN NOW When she had gone he said, laughing:

--We call it D.B.C. END
BEGIN NOW because they have damn bad cakes. END
BEGIN NOW O, but you missed
Dedalus on HAMLET. END
BEGIN NOW Haines opened his newbought book. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm sorry, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds
that have lost their balance. END
BEGIN NOW The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:

--ENGLAND EXPECTS ...

Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter. END
BEGIN NOW --You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. END
BEGIN NOW Wandering
Aengus I call him. END
BEGIN NOW --I am sure he has an IDEE FIXE, Haines said, pinching his chin
thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. END
BEGIN NOW Now I am speculating what it would
be likely to be. END
BEGIN NOW Such persons always have. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely. END
BEGIN NOW --They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. END
BEGIN NOW He will never
capture the Attic note. END
BEGIN NOW The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
death and the ruddy birth. END
BEGIN NOW That is his tragedy. END
BEGIN NOW He can never be a poet. END
BEGIN NOW The joy of creation ...

--Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. END
BEGIN NOW I see. END
BEGIN NOW I tackled him
this morning on belief. END
BEGIN NOW There was something on his mind, I saw. END
BEGIN NOW It's
rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an
interesting point out of that. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. END
BEGIN NOW He helped her
to unload her tray. END
BEGIN NOW --He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
the cheerful cups. END
BEGIN NOW The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of
retribution. END
BEGIN NOW Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. END
BEGIN NOW Does he
write anything for your movement? END
BEGIN NOW He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped
cream. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter
over its smoking pith. END
BEGIN NOW He bit off a soft piece hungrily. END
BEGIN NOW --Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. END
BEGIN NOW He is going to write something
in ten years. END
BEGIN NOW --Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. END
BEGIN NOW Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all. END
BEGIN NOW He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup. END
BEGIN NOW --This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want to be imposed on. END
BEGIN NOW Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping
street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner ROSEVEAN from
Bridgwater with bricks. END

Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. END
BEGIN NOW Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with
stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's
house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. END
BEGIN NOW Distantly behind him a
blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park. END
BEGIN NOW Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as
Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along
Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling. END
BEGIN NOW At the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name
announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
duke's lawn. END
BEGIN NOW His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW With ratsteeth
bared he muttered:

--COACTUS VOLUI. END
BEGIN NOW He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word. END
BEGIN NOW As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his
dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept
onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. END
BEGIN NOW The blind stripling turned his
sickly face after the striding form. END
BEGIN NOW --God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! END
BEGIN NOW You're blinder nor
I am, you bitch's bastard! END

Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam,
pawing the pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he
had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. END

blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and
Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and
sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from
Tunney's. END

their pelts and putting up their props. END

Masters Dignam gaped silently. END

left turned as he turned. END
BEGIN NOW That's me in mourning. END
BEGIN NOW When is it? END
BEGIN NOW May the
twentysecond. END
BEGIN NOW Sure, the blooming thing is all over. END
BEGIN NOW He turned to the right
and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking
up. END
BEGIN NOW Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall,
charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. END
BEGIN NOW One of them mots that do be in
the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of
him for one time he found out. END
BEGIN NOW Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. END
BEGIN NOW The best pucker
going for strength was Fitzsimons. END
BEGIN NOW One puck in the wind from that fellow
would knock you into the middle of next week, man. END
BEGIN NOW But the best pucker
for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of
him, dodging and all. END
BEGIN NOW In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth
and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
telling him and grinning all the time. END
BEGIN NOW No Sandymount tram. END
BEGIN NOW Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to
his other hand. END
BEGIN NOW His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. END
BEGIN NOW The
blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end
to it. END
BEGIN NOW He met schoolboys with satchels. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not going tomorrow either,
stay away till Monday. END
BEGIN NOW He met other schoolboys. END
BEGIN NOW Do they notice I'm in
mourning? END
BEGIN NOW Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Then
they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name. END
BEGIN NOW His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
fly walking over it up to his eye. END
BEGIN NOW The scrunch that was when they were
screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing
it downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
the men how to get it round the bend. END
BEGIN NOW A big coffin it was, and high and
heavylooking. END
BEGIN NOW How was that? END
BEGIN NOW The last night pa was boosed he was standing
on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for
to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. END
BEGIN NOW Never see him
again. END
BEGIN NOW Death, that is. END
BEGIN NOW Pa is dead. END
BEGIN NOW My father is dead. END
BEGIN NOW He told me to be a
good son to ma. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his
tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. END
BEGIN NOW Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam,
my father. END
BEGIN NOW I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to confession to
Father Conroy on Saturday night. END

what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow
furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord
lieutenant. END

Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and

the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. END

BEGIN NOW The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. END
BEGIN NOW For them
unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. END
BEGIN NOW And

--There's your teas, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an
upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low. END
BEGIN NOW --What is it? END
BEGIN NOW loud boots unmannerly asked. END
BEGIN NOW --Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint. END
BEGIN NOW --Your BEAU, is it? END
BEGIN NOW A haughty bronze replied:

--I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
impertinent insolence. END
BEGIN NOW --Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she
threatened as he had come. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW On her flower frowning miss Douce said:

--Most aggravating that young brat is. END
BEGIN NOW If he doesn't conduct himself I'll
wring his ear for him a yard long. END
BEGIN NOW Ladylike in exquisite contrast. END
BEGIN NOW --Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined. END
BEGIN NOW She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. END
BEGIN NOW They cowered
under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,
waiting for their teas to draw. END
BEGIN NOW They pawed their blouses, both of black
satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and
seven. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear,
hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel. END
BEGIN NOW --Am I awfully sunburnt? END
BEGIN NOW Miss bronze unbloused her neck. END
BEGIN NOW --No, said miss Kennedy. END
BEGIN NOW It gets brown after. END
BEGIN NOW Did you try the borax with
the cherry laurel water? END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror
gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst
a shell. END
BEGIN NOW --And leave it to my hands, she said. END
BEGIN NOW --Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised. END
BEGIN NOW Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce

--Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. END
BEGIN NOW I asked that old
fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:

--O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake! END
BEGIN NOW --But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two
ears with little fingers. END
BEGIN NOW --No, don't, she cried. END
BEGIN NOW --I won't listen, she cried. END
BEGIN NOW But Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:

--For your what? END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but
prayed again:

--Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. END
BEGIN NOW The hideous old wretch! END
BEGIN NOW That
night in the Antient Concert Rooms. END
BEGIN NOW She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea. END
BEGIN NOW --Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,
ruffling her nosewings. END
BEGIN NOW Hufa! END
BEGIN NOW Hufa! END
BEGIN NOW Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. END
BEGIN NOW Miss
Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like
a snout in quest. END
BEGIN NOW --O! END
BEGIN NOW shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. END
BEGIN NOW Will you ever forget his goggle eye? END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:

--And your other eye! END
BEGIN NOW Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. END
BEGIN NOW Why do I always
think Figather? END
BEGIN NOW Gathering figs, I think. END
BEGIN NOW And Prosper Lore's huguenot name. END
BEGIN NOW By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. END
BEGIN NOW Bluerobed, white
under, come to me. END
BEGIN NOW God they believe she is: or goddess. END
BEGIN NOW Those today. END
BEGIN NOW I
could not see. END
BEGIN NOW That fellow spoke. END
BEGIN NOW A student. END
BEGIN NOW After with Dedalus' son. END
BEGIN NOW He
might be Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW All comely virgins. END
BEGIN NOW That brings those rakes of fellows
in: her white. END
BEGIN NOW By went his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW The sweets of sin. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet are the sweets. END
BEGIN NOW Of sin. END
BEGIN NOW In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with
Kennedy your other eye. END
BEGIN NOW They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold,
to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each
other,  high piercing notes. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
gigglegiggled. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her
nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her
fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered
out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with
choking, crying:

--O greasy eyes! END
BEGIN NOW Imagine being married to a man like that! END
BEGIN NOW she cried. END
BEGIN NOW With
his bit of beard! END
BEGIN NOW Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
delight, joy, indignation. END
BEGIN NOW --Married to the greasy nose! END
BEGIN NOW she yelled. END
BEGIN NOW Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each
each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,
shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. END
BEGIN NOW And then laughed more. END
BEGIN NOW Greasy I
knows. END
BEGIN NOW Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. END
BEGIN NOW All flushed (O! END
BEGIN NOW ),
panting, sweating (O! END
BEGIN NOW ), all breathless. END
BEGIN NOW Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom. END
BEGIN NOW --O saints above! END
BEGIN NOW miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. END
BEGIN NOW I wished

I hadn't laughed so much. END
BEGIN NOW I feel all wet. END
BEGIN NOW --O, miss Douce! END
BEGIN NOW miss Kennedy protested. END
BEGIN NOW You horrid thing! END
BEGIN NOW And flushed yet more (you horrid! END
BEGIN NOW ), more goldenly. END
BEGIN NOW By Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright
of their oils. END
BEGIN NOW Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at
doors as I. END
BEGIN NOW Religion pays. END
BEGIN NOW Must see him for that par. END
BEGIN NOW Eat first. END
BEGIN NOW I want. END
BEGIN NOW Not yet. END
BEGIN NOW At four, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Time ever passing. END
BEGIN NOW Clockhands turning. END
BEGIN NOW On. END
BEGIN NOW Where eat? END
BEGIN NOW The Clarence, Dolphin. END
BEGIN NOW On. END
BEGIN NOW For Raoul. END
BEGIN NOW Eat. END
BEGIN NOW If I net five
guineas with those ads. END
BEGIN NOW The violet silk petticoats. END
BEGIN NOW Not yet. END
BEGIN NOW The sweets
of sin. END
BEGIN NOW Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled. END
BEGIN NOW Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW Chips, picking chips off one of his
rocky thumbnails. END
BEGIN NOW Chips. END
BEGIN NOW He strolled. END
BEGIN NOW --O, welcome back, miss Douce. END
BEGIN NOW He held her hand. END
BEGIN NOW Enjoyed her holidays? END
BEGIN NOW --Tiptop. END
BEGIN NOW He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor. END
BEGIN NOW --Gorgeous, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the holy show I am. END
BEGIN NOW Lying out on the strand
all day. END
BEGIN NOW Bronze whiteness. END
BEGIN NOW --That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed
her hand indulgently. END
BEGIN NOW Tempting poor simple males. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away. END
BEGIN NOW --O go away! END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW You're very simple, I don't think. END
BEGIN NOW He was. END
BEGIN NOW --Well now I am, he mused. END
BEGIN NOW I looked so simple in the cradle they christened
me simple Simon. END
BEGIN NOW --You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. END
BEGIN NOW And what did the
doctor order today? END
BEGIN NOW --Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. END
BEGIN NOW I think I'll trouble you
for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle. END
BEGIN NOW --With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed. END
BEGIN NOW With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and
Cochrane's she turned herself. END
BEGIN NOW With grace she tapped a measure of gold
whisky from her crystal keg. END
BEGIN NOW Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus
brought pouch and pipe. END
BEGIN NOW Alacrity she served. END
BEGIN NOW He blew through the flue two
husky fifenotes. END
BEGIN NOW --By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. END
BEGIN NOW Must be
a great tonic in the air down there. END
BEGIN NOW But a long threatening comes at last,
they say. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into
the bowl. END
BEGIN NOW Chips. END
BEGIN NOW Shreds. END
BEGIN NOW Musing. END
BEGIN NOW Mute. END
BEGIN NOW None nought said nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:

--O, IDOLORES, QUEEN OF THE EASTERN SEAS! END
BEGIN NOW --Was Mr Lidwell in today? END
BEGIN NOW In came Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Round him peered Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. END
BEGIN NOW To Martha I must write. END
BEGIN NOW Buy paper. END
BEGIN NOW Daly's. END
BEGIN NOW Girl there civil. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Old Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Blue bloom is on the rye. END
BEGIN NOW --He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan came forward. END
BEGIN NOW --Was Mr Boylan looking for me? END
BEGIN NOW He asked. END
BEGIN NOW She answered:

--Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs? END
BEGIN NOW She asked. END
BEGIN NOW Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised,
her gaze upon a page:

--No. END
BEGIN NOW He was not. END
BEGIN NOW Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan round the
sandwichbell wound his round body round. END
BEGIN NOW --Peep! END
BEGIN NOW Who's in the corner? END
BEGIN NOW No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. END
BEGIN NOW To mind
her stops. END
BEGIN NOW To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle jaunty jingle. END
BEGIN NOW Girlgold she read and did not glance. END
BEGIN NOW Take no notice. END
BEGIN NOW She took no
notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:

--Ah fox met ah stork. END
BEGIN NOW Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your
bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone? END
BEGIN NOW He droned in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce turned to her tea aside. END
BEGIN NOW He sighed aside:

--Ah me! END
BEGIN NOW O my! END
BEGIN NOW He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod. END
BEGIN NOW --Greetings from the famous son of a famous father. END
BEGIN NOW --Who may he be? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan opened most genial arms. END
BEGIN NOW Who? END
BEGIN NOW --Who may he be? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Can you ask? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, the youthful bard. END
BEGIN NOW Dry. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe. END
BEGIN NOW --I see, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't recognise him for the moment. END
BEGIN NOW I hear he is
keeping very select company. END
BEGIN NOW Have you seen him lately? END
BEGIN NOW He had. END
BEGIN NOW --I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW In
Mooney's EN VILLE and in Mooney's SUR MER. END
BEGIN NOW He had received the rhino for
the labour of his muse. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:

--The ELITE of Erin hung upon his lips. END
BEGIN NOW The ponderous pundit, Hugh

MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy
of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the
O'Madden Burke. END
BEGIN NOW After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and

--That must have been highly diverting, said he. END
BEGIN NOW I see. END
BEGIN NOW He see. END
BEGIN NOW He drank. END
BEGIN NOW With faraway mourning mountain eye. END
BEGIN NOW Set down
his glass. END
BEGIN NOW He looked towards the saloon door. END
BEGIN NOW --I see you have moved the piano. END
BEGIN NOW --The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking
concert and I never heard such an exquisite player. END
BEGIN NOW --Is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW --Didn't he, miss Kennedy? END
BEGIN NOW The real classical, you know. END
BEGIN NOW And blind too,
poor fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Not twenty I'm sure he was. END
BEGIN NOW --Is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW He drank and strayed away. END
BEGIN NOW --So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled. END
BEGIN NOW God's curse on bitch's bastard. END
BEGIN NOW Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. END
BEGIN NOW To the door of the bar and
diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of
Ormond. END
BEGIN NOW Lager for diner. END
BEGIN NOW Lager without alacrity she served. END
BEGIN NOW With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for
jinglejaunty blazes boy. END
BEGIN NOW Upholding the lid he (who?) END
BEGIN NOW gazed in the coffin (coffin?) END
BEGIN NOW at the
oblique triple (piano!) END
BEGIN NOW wires. END
BEGIN NOW He pressed (the same who pressed
indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the
thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action. END
BEGIN NOW Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was
in Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. END
BEGIN NOW Are you not
happy in your home? END
BEGIN NOW Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. END
BEGIN NOW Means
something, language of flow. END
BEGIN NOW Was it a daisy? END
BEGIN NOW Innocence that is. END
BEGIN NOW Respectable girl meet after mass. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks awfully muchly. END
BEGIN NOW Wise Bloom eyed
on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. END
BEGIN NOW Smoke
mermaids, coolest whiff of all. END
BEGIN NOW Hair streaming: lovelorn. END
BEGIN NOW For some man. END
BEGIN NOW For Raoul. END
BEGIN NOW He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a
jaunting car. END
BEGIN NOW It is. END
BEGIN NOW Again. END
BEGIN NOW Third time. END
BEGIN NOW Coincidence. END
BEGIN NOW Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond
quay. END
BEGIN NOW Follow. END
BEGIN NOW Risk it. END
BEGIN NOW Go quick. END
BEGIN NOW At four. END
BEGIN NOW Near now. END
BEGIN NOW Out. END
BEGIN NOW --Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say. END
BEGIN NOW --Aha ... END
BEGIN NOW I was forgetting ... END
BEGIN NOW Excuse ...

--And four. END
BEGIN NOW At four she. END
BEGIN NOW Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. END
BEGIN NOW Bloo smi qui
go. END
BEGIN NOW Ternoon. END
BEGIN NOW Think you're the only pebble on the beach? END
BEGIN NOW Does that to all. END
BEGIN NOW For men. END
BEGIN NOW In drowsy silence gold bent on her page. END
BEGIN NOW From the saloon a call came, long in dying. END
BEGIN NOW That was a tuningfork the
tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. END
BEGIN NOW A call again. END
BEGIN NOW That he now
poised that it now throbbed. END
BEGIN NOW You hear? END
BEGIN NOW It throbbed, pure, purer, softly
and softlier, its buzzing prongs. END
BEGIN NOW Longer in dying call. END
BEGIN NOW Pat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and
popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with Miss

Douce. END
BEGIN NOW --THE BRIGHT STARS FADE ...

A voiceless song sang from within, singing:

-- ... END
BEGIN NOW THE MORN IS BREAKING. END
BEGIN NOW A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive
hands. END
BEGIN NOW Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,
called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's
leavetaking, life's, love's morn. END
BEGIN NOW --THE DEWDROPS PEARL ...

Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy. END
BEGIN NOW --But look this way, he said, rose of Castile. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped. END
BEGIN NOW She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,
dreamily rose. END
BEGIN NOW --Did she fall or was she pushed? END
BEGIN NOW he asked her. END
BEGIN NOW She answered, slighting:

--Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies. END
BEGIN NOW Like lady, ladylike. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he
strode. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan heard and knew
and hailed him:

--See the conquering hero comes. END
BEGIN NOW Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom,
unconquered hero. END
BEGIN NOW See me he might. END
BEGIN NOW The seat he sat on: warm. END
BEGIN NOW Black wary
hecat walked towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting. END
BEGIN NOW --AND I FROM THEE ...

--I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. END
BEGIN NOW She
smiled on him. END
BEGIN NOW But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her
richer hair, a bosom and a rose. END
BEGIN NOW Smart Boylan bespoke potions. END
BEGIN NOW --What's your cry? END
BEGIN NOW Glass of bitter? END
BEGIN NOW Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin
for me. END
BEGIN NOW Wire in yet? END
BEGIN NOW Not yet. END
BEGIN NOW At four she. END
BEGIN NOW Who said four? END
BEGIN NOW Cowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office. END
BEGIN NOW Avoid. END
BEGIN NOW Goulding a chance. END
BEGIN NOW What is he doing in the Ormond? END
BEGIN NOW Car waiting. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END
BEGIN NOW Where off to? END
BEGIN NOW Something to eat? END
BEGIN NOW I too was just. END
BEGIN NOW In here. END
BEGIN NOW What,
Ormond? END
BEGIN NOW Best value in Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Is that so? END
BEGIN NOW Diningroom. END
BEGIN NOW Sit tight there. END
BEGIN NOW See, not be seen. END
BEGIN NOW I think I'll join you. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Richie led on. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom
followed bag. END
BEGIN NOW Dinner fit for a prince. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm,
her bust, that all but burst, so high. END
BEGIN NOW --O! END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph. END
BEGIN NOW --Why don't you grow? END
BEGIN NOW asked Blazes Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his
lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him? END
BEGIN NOW ), and
syrupped with her voice:

--Fine goods in small parcels. END
BEGIN NOW That is to say she. END
BEGIN NOW Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe. END
BEGIN NOW --Here's fortune, Blazes said. END
BEGIN NOW He pitched a broad coin down. END
BEGIN NOW Coin rang. END
BEGIN NOW --Hold on, said Lenehan, till I ...

--Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale. END
BEGIN NOW --Sceptre will win in a canter, he said. END
BEGIN NOW --I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. END
BEGIN NOW Not on my own, you
know. END
BEGIN NOW Fancy of a friend of mine. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's
lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled. END
BEGIN NOW Idolores. END
BEGIN NOW The eastern seas. END
BEGIN NOW Clock whirred. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who
gave), bearing away teatray. END
BEGIN NOW Clock clacked. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. END
BEGIN NOW It
clanged. END
BEGIN NOW Clock clacked. END
BEGIN NOW Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till
and hummed and handed coins in change. END
BEGIN NOW Look to the west. END
BEGIN NOW A clack. END
BEGIN NOW For me. END
BEGIN NOW --What time is that? END
BEGIN NOW asked Blazes Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW Four? END
BEGIN NOW O'clock. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming,
tugged Blazes Boylan's elbowsleeve. END
BEGIN NOW --Let's hear the time, he said. END
BEGIN NOW The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered
tables. END
BEGIN NOW Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table
near the door. END
BEGIN NOW Be near. END
BEGIN NOW At four. END
BEGIN NOW Has he forgotten? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps a trick. END
BEGIN NOW Not
come: whet appetite. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't do. END
BEGIN NOW Wait, wait. END
BEGIN NOW Pat, waiter, waited. END
BEGIN NOW Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --Go on, pressed Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW There's no-one. END
BEGIN NOW He never heard. END
BEGIN NOW -- ... TO FLORA'S LIPS DID HIE. END
BEGIN NOW High, a high note pealed in the treble clear. END
BEGIN NOW Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought

Blazes Boylan's flower and eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --Please, please. END
BEGIN NOW He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal. END
BEGIN NOW --I COULD NOT LEAVE THEE ...

--Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly. END
BEGIN NOW --No, now, urged Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW SONNEZLACLOCHE! END
BEGIN NOW O do! END
BEGIN NOW There's no-one. END
BEGIN NOW She looked. END
BEGIN NOW Quick. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Kenn out of earshot. END
BEGIN NOW Sudden bent. END
BEGIN NOW Two
kindling faces watched her bend. END
BEGIN NOW Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,
and lost and found it, faltering. END
BEGIN NOW --Go on! END
BEGIN NOW Do! END
BEGIN NOW SONNEZ! END
BEGIN NOW Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. END
BEGIN NOW Delayed. END
BEGIN NOW Taunted
them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --SONNEZ! END
BEGIN NOW Smack. END
BEGIN NOW She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter
smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh. END
BEGIN NOW --LA CLOCHE! END
BEGIN NOW cried gleeful Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Trained by owner. END
BEGIN NOW No sawdust there. END
BEGIN NOW She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! END
BEGIN NOW aren't men? END
BEGIN NOW ), but, lightward
gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW --You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said. END
BEGIN NOW Boylan, eyed, eyed. END
BEGIN NOW Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice
tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. END
BEGIN NOW His spellbound eyes went
after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded
arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell,
where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, bronze from anearby. END
BEGIN NOW -- ... SWEETHEART, GOODBYE! END
BEGIN NOW --I'm off, said Boylan with impatience. END
BEGIN NOW He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change. END
BEGIN NOW --Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford ...

--Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan gulped to go. END
BEGIN NOW --Got the horn or what? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW I'm coming. END
BEGIN NOW He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the
threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender. END
BEGIN NOW --How do you do, Mr Dollard? END
BEGIN NOW --Eh? END
BEGIN NOW How do? END
BEGIN NOW How do? END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an
instant from Father Cowley's woe. END
BEGIN NOW He won't give you any trouble, Bob. END
BEGIN NOW Alf
Bergan will speak to the long fellow. END
BEGIN NOW We'll put a barleystraw in that
Judas Iscariot's ear this time. END
BEGIN NOW Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an
eyelid. END
BEGIN NOW --Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Simon. END
BEGIN NOW Give us a
ditty. END
BEGIN NOW We heard the piano. END
BEGIN NOW Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. END
BEGIN NOW Power for Richie. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW Let me see. END
BEGIN NOW Not make him walk twice. END
BEGIN NOW His corns. END
BEGIN NOW Four now. END
BEGIN NOW How warm this black is. END
BEGIN NOW Course nerves a bit. END
BEGIN NOW Refracts (is it?) END
BEGIN NOW heat. END
BEGIN NOW Let
me see. END
BEGIN NOW Cider. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, bottle of cider. END
BEGIN NOW --What's that? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW I was only vamping, man. END
BEGIN NOW --Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. END
BEGIN NOW Begone dull care. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Bob. END
BEGIN NOW He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with
the: hold him now) into the saloon. END
BEGIN NOW He plumped him Dollard on the stool. END
BEGIN NOW His gouty paws plumped chords. END
BEGIN NOW Plumped, stopped abrupt. END
BEGIN NOW Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. END
BEGIN NOW Bothered, he
wanted Power and cider. END
BEGIN NOW Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from
afar. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle a tinkle jaunted. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. END
BEGIN NOW He's off. END
BEGIN NOW Light sob of breath Bloom
sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. END
BEGIN NOW Jingling. END
BEGIN NOW He's gone. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle. END
BEGIN NOW Hear. END
BEGIN NOW --Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW God be with old times. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,
smitten by sunlight. END
BEGIN NOW Gone. END
BEGIN NOW Pensive (who knows? END
BEGIN NOW ), smitten (the smiting
light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. END
BEGIN NOW She drew down
pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) END
BEGIN NOW about her bronze, over the bar
where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast
inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow,
EAU DE NIL. END
BEGIN NOW --Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded
them. END
BEGIN NOW There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the
Collard grand. END
BEGIN NOW There was. END
BEGIN NOW --A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW The devil wouldn't stop him. END
BEGIN NOW He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink. END
BEGIN NOW --God, do you remember? END
BEGIN NOW Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the
punished keyboard. END
BEGIN NOW And by Japers I had no wedding garment. END
BEGIN NOW They laughed all three. END
BEGIN NOW He had no wed. All trio laughed. END
BEGIN NOW No wedding
garment. END
BEGIN NOW --Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Where's
my pipe, by the way? END
BEGIN NOW He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. END
BEGIN NOW Bald Pat carried
two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. END
BEGIN NOW And Father Cowley laughed again. END

I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the

me a wrinkle about him--lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay

hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury
street. END
BEGIN NOW --Circumcised? END

hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny
out of him. END

BEGIN NOW Collector of bad and doubtful
debts. END
BEGIN NOW But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's
walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. END
BEGIN NOW TELL
HIM, says he, I DARE HIM, says he, AND I DOUBLEDARE HIM TO SEND YOU ROUND
HERE AGAIN OR IF HE DOES, says he, I'LL HAVE HIM SUMMONSED UP BEFORE THE
COURT, SO I WILL, FOR TRADING WITHOUT A LICENCE. END

himself till he's fit to burst. END

getting his shirt out. END

BEGIN NOW For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint
Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant,
hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.

BEGIN NOW Anything strange or wonderful, Joe? END
BEGIN NOW --Not a word, says Joe. END

BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW --Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. END
BEGIN NOW I want to
give the citizen the hard word about it. END

courthouse talking of one thing or another. END
BEGIN NOW Decent fellow Joe when he has
it but sure like that he never has it. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, I couldn't get over that
bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. END
BEGIN NOW For trading without a licence,
says he. END
BEGIN NOW In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. END
BEGIN NOW There
rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. END
BEGIN NOW There sleep the mighty dead as in
life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. END
BEGIN NOW A pleasant land it
is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard,
the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse,
the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish
generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be
enumerated. END
BEGIN NOW In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty
trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty
sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic
eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that
region is thoroughly well supplied. END
BEGIN NOW Lovely maidens sit in close proximity
to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they
play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots,
silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of
fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. END
BEGIN NOW And heroes voyage from
afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of
unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster
and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district
of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings. END
BEGIN NOW And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by
mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that
purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that
land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended
from chieftains. END
BEGIN NOW Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the
fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks,
Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes,
spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and
trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and
custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow
brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of
strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and
strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes. END
BEGIN NOW I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. END
BEGIN NOW Come out here, Geraghty,
you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! END
BEGIN NOW And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and
flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium
steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep
and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales
of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly
Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of
the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and
butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of
lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in
size, the agate with this dun. END
BEGIN NOW So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen
up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody
mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop
in the way of drink. END
BEGIN NOW --There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his
load of papers, working for the cause. END
BEGIN NOW The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. END
BEGIN NOW Be
a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that
bloody dog. END
BEGIN NOW I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a
constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper
about a licence. END
BEGIN NOW --Stand and deliver, says he. END
BEGIN NOW --That's all right, citizen, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Friends here. END
BEGIN NOW --Pass, friends, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:

--What's your opinion of the times? END
BEGIN NOW Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. END
BEGIN NOW But, begob, Joe was equal to
the occasion. END
BEGIN NOW --I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his
fork. END
BEGIN NOW So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:

--Foreign wars is the cause of it. END
BEGIN NOW And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:

--It's the Russians wish to tyrannise. END
BEGIN NOW --Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I
wouldn't sell for half a crown. END
BEGIN NOW --Give it a name, citizen, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Wine of the country, says he. END
BEGIN NOW --What's yours? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Ditto MacAnaspey, says I. END
BEGIN NOW --Three pints, Terry, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And how's the old heart, citizen? END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW --Never better, A CHARA, says he. END
BEGIN NOW What Garry? END
BEGIN NOW Are we going to win? END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck
and, by Jesus, he near throttled him. END
BEGIN NOW The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower
was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed
redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed
longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced
sinewyarmed hero. END
BEGIN NOW From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and
his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of
his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in
hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (ULEX EUROPEUS). END
BEGIN NOW The
widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected,
were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the
fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. END
BEGIN NOW The eyes in which a tear and
a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized
cauliflower. END
BEGIN NOW A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals
from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the
loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered
rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still
loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble. END
BEGIN NOW He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the
knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of
plaited straw and rushes. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly
stitched with gut. END
BEGIN NOW His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan
buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted
cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. END
BEGIN NOW From his girdle hung a
row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame
and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of
many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred
battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art

BEGIN NOW A
couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet
reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps
announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by
hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time
to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of
paleolithic stone. END

the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as
I'm telling you. END

BEGIN NOW --And there's more where that came from, says he. END
BEGIN NOW --Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW --Sweat of my brow, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze. END
BEGIN NOW --I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and
Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish. END
BEGIN NOW Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? END
BEGIN NOW O'Bloom,
the son of Rory: it is he. END
BEGIN NOW Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he
of the prudent soul. END
BEGIN NOW --For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised
organ. END
BEGIN NOW The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. END
BEGIN NOW And look at this
blasted rag, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Look at this, says he. END
BEGIN NOW THE IRISH INDEPENDENT, if you
please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. END
BEGIN NOW Listen to the
births and deaths in the IRISH ALL FOR IRELAND INDEPENDENT, and I'll thank
you and the marriages. END
BEGIN NOW And he starts reading them out:

--Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on
Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. END
BEGIN NOW How's that, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Wright and
Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late
George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and
Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean
of Worcester. END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW Deaths. END
BEGIN NOW Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke
Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house,
Chepstow ...

--I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience. END
BEGIN NOW --Cockburn. END
BEGIN NOW Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,
Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,
Liverpool, Isabella Helen. END

son! END
BEGIN NOW How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber? END
BEGIN NOW --Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks be to God they had
the start of us. END
BEGIN NOW Drink that, citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --I will, says he, honourable person. END
BEGIN NOW --Health, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW And all down the form. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Ow! END
BEGIN NOW Don't be talking! END
BEGIN NOW I was blue mouldy for the want of that
pint. END
BEGIN NOW Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a
click. END
BEGIN NOW And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came
swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him
there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred
scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,
fairest of her race. END
BEGIN NOW Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's
snug, squeezed up with the laughing. END
BEGIN NOW And who was sitting up there in the
corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. END
BEGIN NOW And
begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his
bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife
hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. END
BEGIN NOW I
thought Alf would split. END
BEGIN NOW --Look at him, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Breen. END
BEGIN NOW He's traipsing all round Dublin with a
postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li ...

And he doubled up. END
BEGIN NOW --Take a what? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW --Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds. END
BEGIN NOW --O hell! END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you
seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs. END
BEGIN NOW --BI I DHO HUSHT, says he. END
BEGIN NOW --Who? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Breen, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round
to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round
to the subsheriff's for a lark. END
BEGIN NOW O God, I've a pain laughing. END
BEGIN NOW U. p: up. END
BEGIN NOW The
long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old
lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man. END
BEGIN NOW --When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Alf Bergan? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Hanging? END
BEGIN NOW Wait till I show you. END
BEGIN NOW Here, Terry, give us a
pony. END
BEGIN NOW That bloody old fool! END
BEGIN NOW Ten thousand pounds. END
BEGIN NOW You should have seen long
John's eye. END
BEGIN NOW U. p ...

And he started laughing. END
BEGIN NOW --Who are you laughing at? END
BEGIN NOW says Bob Doran. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Bergan? END
BEGIN NOW --Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal
cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh
and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of
deathless Leda. END
BEGIN NOW For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass
and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and
bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their
toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat. END
BEGIN NOW Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,
that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that
thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals. END
BEGIN NOW But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone
in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon
of costliest bronze. END
BEGIN NOW Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the
image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria
her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond
the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who
bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew
and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the
pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop. END
BEGIN NOW --What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and
down outside? END
BEGIN NOW --What's that? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. END
BEGIN NOW Talking about hanging,
I'll show you something you never saw. END
BEGIN NOW Hangmen's letters. END
BEGIN NOW Look at here. END
BEGIN NOW So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW --Are you codding? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW --Honest injun, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Read them. END
BEGIN NOW So Joe took up the letters. END
BEGIN NOW --Who are you laughing at? END
BEGIN NOW says Bob Doran. END
BEGIN NOW So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap
when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:

--How's Willy Murray those times, Alf? END
BEGIN NOW --I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy
Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW Only I was running after that ...

--You what? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe, throwing down the letters. END
BEGIN NOW With who? END
BEGIN NOW --With Dignam, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --Is it Paddy? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW --Don't you know he's dead? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Paddy Dignam dead! END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a
pikestaff. END
BEGIN NOW --Who's dead? END
BEGIN NOW says Bob Doran. END
BEGIN NOW --You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm. END
BEGIN NOW --What? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Good Christ, only five ... What? END
BEGIN NOW ... And Willy Murray
with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's ... What? END
BEGIN NOW Dignam dead? END
BEGIN NOW --What about Dignam? END
BEGIN NOW says Bob Doran. END
BEGIN NOW Who's talking about... ? END
BEGIN NOW --Dead! END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW He's no more dead than you are. END
BEGIN NOW --Maybe so, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW They took the liberty of burying him this morning
anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW --Paddy? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him. END
BEGIN NOW --Good Christ! END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted. END
BEGIN NOW In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by
tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the
etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic
rays from the crown of the head and face. END
BEGIN NOW Communication was effected
through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and
scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. END
BEGIN NOW Questioned
by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that
he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to
trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral
levels. END
BEGIN NOW In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great
divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly
but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic
development opened up to them. END
BEGIN NOW Interrogated as to whether life there
resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from
more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped
with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda,
wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy
of the very purest nature. END
BEGIN NOW Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was
brought and evidently afforded relief. END
BEGIN NOW Asked if he had any message
for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya
to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that
Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the
ram has power. END
BEGIN NOW It was then queried whether there were any special
desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: WE GREET YOU,
FRIENDS OF EARTH, WHO ARE STILL IN THE BODY. END
BEGIN NOW MIND C. K. DOESN'T PILE IT
ON. END
BEGIN NOW It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher,
manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a
personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying
out of the interment arrangements. END
BEGIN NOW Before departing he requested that it
should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been
looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that
the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were
still good. END
BEGIN NOW He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in
the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made
known. END
BEGIN NOW Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was
intimated that this had given satisfaction. END
BEGIN NOW He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. END
BEGIN NOW Fleet
was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. END
BEGIN NOW Wail, Banba, with
your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind. END
BEGIN NOW --There he is again, says the citizen, staring out. END
BEGIN NOW --Who? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW --Bloom, says he. END
BEGIN NOW He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten
minutes. END
BEGIN NOW And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again. END
BEGIN NOW Little Alf was knocked bawways. END
BEGIN NOW Faith, he was. END
BEGIN NOW --Good Christ! END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW I could have sworn it was him. END
BEGIN NOW And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest
blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:

--Who said Christ is good? END
BEGIN NOW --I beg your parsnips, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy
Dignam? END
BEGIN NOW --Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. END
BEGIN NOW He's over all his troubles. END
BEGIN NOW But Bob Doran shouts out of him. END
BEGIN NOW --He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they
didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. END
BEGIN NOW And Bob
Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there. END
BEGIN NOW --The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character. END
BEGIN NOW The tear is bloody near your eye. END
BEGIN NOW Talking through his bloody hat. END
BEGIN NOW Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,
Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street,
that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that
was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing
her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour. END
BEGIN NOW --The noblest, the truest, says he. END
BEGIN NOW And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor
little Paddy Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that
beam of heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing
round the door. END
BEGIN NOW --Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry
was Martin Cunningham there. END
BEGIN NOW --O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. END
BEGIN NOW Listen to this,
will you? END
BEGIN NOW And he starts reading out one. END
BEGIN NOW 7 HUNTER STREET, LIVERPOOL. END
BEGIN NOW TO THE HIGH SHERIFF OF DUBLIN, DUBLIN. END
BEGIN NOW HONOURED SIR I BEG TO OFFER MY SERVICES IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED PAINFUL
CASE I HANGED JOE GANN IN BOOTLE JAIL ON THE 12 OF FEBUARY 1900 AND I
HANGED ...

--Show us, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW -- ... END
BEGIN NOW PRIVATE ARTHUR CHACE FOR FOWL MURDER OF JESSIE TILSIT IN
PENTONVILLE PRISON AND I WAS ASSISTANT WHEN ...

--Jesus, says I. END
BEGIN NOW -- ... BILLINGTON EXECUTED THE AWFUL MURDERER TOAD SMITH ... END
BEGIN NOW The citizen made a grab at the letter. END
BEGIN NOW --Hold hard, says Joe, I HAVE A SPECIAL NACK OF PUTTING THE NOOSE ONCE IN
HE CAN'T GET OUT HOPING TO BE FAVOURED I REMAIN, HONOURED SIR, MY TERMS IS
FIVE GINNEES. END
BEGIN NOW H. RUMBOLD,
                MASTER BARBER. END
BEGIN NOW --And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Here, says he, take them
to hell out of my sight, Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have? END
BEGIN NOW So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't
and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said
well he'd just take a cigar. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake. END
BEGIN NOW --Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card
with a black border round it. END
BEGIN NOW --They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang
their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses. END
BEGIN NOW And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his
heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they
chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull. END
BEGIN NOW In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. END
BEGIN NOW Their
deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever
wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so
saith the Lord. END
BEGIN NOW So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom
comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the
business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies
does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't
know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on. END
BEGIN NOW --There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --What's that? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --That so? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --God's truth, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW I heard that from the head warder that was in

Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. END
BEGIN NOW He told me when
they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a
poker. END
BEGIN NOW --Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said. END
BEGIN NOW --That can be explained by science, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW It's only a natural
phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the ...

And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and
science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon. END
BEGIN NOW The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft
tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of
the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated
to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus
of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic
pores of the CORPORA CAVERNOSA to rapidly dilate in such a way as to
instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human
anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which
has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards
philoprogenitive erection IN ARTICULO MORTIS PER DIMINUTIONEM CAPITIS. END
BEGIN NOW So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and
the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with
him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the
cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and
the other. END
BEGIN NOW Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so
he ought. END
BEGIN NOW Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place
and scratching his scabs. END
BEGIN NOW And round he goes to Bob Doran that was
standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. END
BEGIN NOW So of course Bob
Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:

--Give us the paw! END
BEGIN NOW Give the paw, doggy! END
BEGIN NOW Good old doggy! END
BEGIN NOW Give the paw
here! END
BEGIN NOW Give us the paw! END
BEGIN NOW Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him
from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he
talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred
dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. END
BEGIN NOW Then he starts scraping
a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry
to bring. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
out of him a yard long for more. END
BEGIN NOW Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody
mongrel. END
BEGIN NOW And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the
brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert
Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara
Curran and she's far from the land. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom, of course, with his
knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. END
BEGIN NOW Phenomenon! END
BEGIN NOW The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a
ballalley. END
BEGIN NOW Time they were stopping up in the CITY ARMS pisser Burke told
me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and
Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing
bezique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat
of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking
the lout out for a walk. END
BEGIN NOW And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and,
by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk
as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol
and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer
story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom with his BUT DON'T YOU SEE? END
BEGIN NOW and BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. END
BEGIN NOW And sure,
more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's,
round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week
after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody
establishment. END
BEGIN NOW Phenomenon! END
BEGIN NOW --The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
glaring at Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, ay, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW What I mean is ...

--SINN FEIN! END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW SINN FEIN AMHAIN! END
BEGIN NOW The friends we love are
by our side and the foes we hate before us. END
BEGIN NOW The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. END
BEGIN NOW From the belfries far
and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the
gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums
punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. END
BEGIN NOW The deafening
claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the
ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. END
BEGIN NOW A torrential rain
poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads
of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five
hundred thousand persons. END
BEGIN NOW A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police
superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in
the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away
the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped
instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by
Speranza's plaintive muse. END
BEGIN NOW Special quick excursion trains and upholstered
charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of
whom there were large contingents. END
BEGIN NOW Considerable amusement was caused
by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang THE
NIGHT BEFORE LARRY WAS STRETCHED in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. END
BEGIN NOW Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among
lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for
real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned
pennies. END
BEGIN NOW The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who
thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this
unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due
to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording
the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. END
BEGIN NOW The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was
chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the
grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends
of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. END
BEGIN NOW The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore
Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed DOYEN of the party who had
to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane),
Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitepatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire
Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von

BEGIN NOW All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the
strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless
barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. END
BEGIN NOW An animated
altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I.
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct
date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. END
BEGIN NOW In the course of the
argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots,
meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig
iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. END
BEGIN NOW The baby
policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from
Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude
proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for
both contending parties. END
BEGIN NOW The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once
appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. END
BEGIN NOW Constable MacFadden was
heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were
bleeding profusely. END
BEGIN NOW Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated
from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal
adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his
thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the
pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their
senses. END
BEGIN NOW The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and
gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their
rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme. END
BEGIN NOW Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the GLADIOLUS CRUENTUS. END
BEGIN NOW He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so
many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate--short, painstaking yet withal
so characteristic of the man. END
BEGIN NOW The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman
was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the
viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the
even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of
cries, HOCH, BANZAI, ELJEN, ZIVIO, CHINCHIN, POLLA KRONIA, HIPHIP, VIVE,
ALLAH, amid which the ringing EVVIVA of the delegate of the land of song
(a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the
eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily
distinguishable. END
BEGIN NOW It was exactly seventeen o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW The signal for prayer
was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were
bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the
possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by
his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. END
BEGIN NOW The learned prelate who
administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when
about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool
of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the
throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. END
BEGIN NOW Hand by the block stood
the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a
tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which
his eyes glowered furiously. END
BEGIN NOW As he awaited the fatal signal he
tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his
brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of
sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary
office. END
BEGIN NOW On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the
quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances
(specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round
and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the
duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully
extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most
precious blood of the most precious victim. END
BEGIN NOW The housesteward of the
amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these
vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. END
BEGIN NOW Quite an
excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions,
done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had
been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption
of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits
when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the
proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare
in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the
dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be
divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent
roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. END
BEGIN NOW The NEC and
NON PLUS ULTRA of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst
her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon
the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for
her sake. END
BEGIN NOW The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring
fondly SHEILA, MY OWN. END
BEGIN NOW Encouraged by this use of her christian name she
kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the
decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. END
BEGIN NOW She swore to him
as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever
cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to
his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling
match in Clonturk park. END
BEGIN NOW She brought back to his recollection the happy
days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they
had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the
dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators,
including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. END
BEGIN NOW That
monster audience simply rocked with delight. END
BEGIN NOW But anon they were overcome
with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. END
BEGIN NOW A fresh torrent of
tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people,
touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least
affected being the aged prebendary himself. END
BEGIN NOW Big strong men, officers of
the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary,
were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say
that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. END
BEGIN NOW A most
romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate,
noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and,
presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree,
solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to
name the day, and was accepted on the spot. END
BEGIN NOW Every lady in the
audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion
in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous
act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant
young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured
names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing FIANCEE
an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a
fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, even the stern
provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson,
who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number
of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain
his natural emotion. END
BEGIN NOW With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive
tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be
in his immediate ENTOURAGE, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:

--God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. END
BEGIN NOW Blimey it
makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I
thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way. END
BEGIN NOW So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak
their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for
a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that
he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the
antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Antitreating
is about the size of it. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink
down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever
see the froth of his pint. END
BEGIN NOW And one night I went in with a fellow
into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could
get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow
with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot
of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals
and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
entertainment, don't be talking. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland sober is Ireland free. END
BEGIN NOW And then
an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. END
BEGIN NOW And one or two sky
pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females,
hitting below the belt. END
BEGIN NOW So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
starts mousing around by Joe and me. END
BEGIN NOW I'd train him by kindness, so I
would, if he was my dog. END
BEGIN NOW Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where
it wouldn't blind him. END
BEGIN NOW --Afraid he'll bite you? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen, jeering. END
BEGIN NOW --No, says I. END
BEGIN NOW But he might take my leg for a lamppost. END
BEGIN NOW So he calls the old dog over. END
BEGIN NOW --What's on you, Garry? END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and
the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. END
BEGIN NOW Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. END
BEGIN NOW Someone that
has nothing better to do ought to write a letter PRO BONO PUBLICO to the
papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. END
BEGIN NOW Growling and
grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the
hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws. END
BEGIN NOW All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among
the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the SOBRIQUET of
Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and
acquaintances Owen Garry. END
BEGIN NOW The exhibition, which is the result of years of
training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises,
among other achievements, the recitation of verse. END
BEGIN NOW Our greatest living
phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) END
BEGIN NOW has left no stone
unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has
found it bears a STRIKING resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns
of ancient Celtic bards. END
BEGIN NOW We are not speaking so much of those delightful
lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the
graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the
bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an
interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the
harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions
of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more
modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. END
BEGIN NOW We subjoin a
specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar
whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though
we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather
more than an indication. END
BEGIN NOW The metrical system of the canine original,
which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of
the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our
readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps
it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's
verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive
of suppressed rancour. END
BEGIN NOW THE CURSE OF MY CURSES
    SEVEN DAYS EVERY DAY
    AND SEVEN DRY THURSDAYS
    ON YOU, BARNEY KIERNAN,
    HAS NO SUP OF WATER
    TO COOL MY COURAGE,
    AND MY GUTS RED ROARING
    AFTER LOWRY'S LIGHTS. END
BEGIN NOW So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
hear him lapping it up a mile off. END
BEGIN NOW And Joe asked him would he have
another. END
BEGIN NOW --I will, says he, A CHARA, to show there's no ill feeling. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. END
BEGIN NOW Arsing around from
one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog
and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. END
BEGIN NOW Entertainment for
man and beast. END
BEGIN NOW And says Joe:

--Could you make a hole in another pint? END
BEGIN NOW --Could a swim duck? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW --Same again, Terry, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Are you sure you won't have anything in the
way of liquid refreshment? END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW --Thank you, no, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet
Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. END
BEGIN NOW Martin asked me to go to the house. END
BEGIN NOW You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't
serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and
nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy. END
BEGIN NOW --Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is
landed. END
BEGIN NOW So the wife comes out top dog, what? END
BEGIN NOW --Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers. END
BEGIN NOW --Whose admirers? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act
like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of
the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam
owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the
mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his
mortgagor under the act. END
BEGIN NOW He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under
the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. END
BEGIN NOW Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged
lottery. END
BEGIN NOW True as you're there. END
BEGIN NOW O, commend me to an israelite! END
BEGIN NOW Royal and
privileged Hungarian robbery. END
BEGIN NOW So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs
Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the
funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that
there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell
her. END
BEGIN NOW Choking with bloody foolery. END
BEGIN NOW And shaking Bloom's hand doing the
tragic to tell her that. END
BEGIN NOW Shake hands, brother. END
BEGIN NOW You're a rogue and I'm
another. END
BEGIN NOW --Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however
slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,
as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of
you this favour. END
BEGIN NOW But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve
let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness. END
BEGIN NOW --No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust
to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of
sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the
bitterness of the cup. END
BEGIN NOW --Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. END
BEGIN NOW The goodness of your heart, I
feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
speech. END
BEGIN NOW And off with him and out trying to walk straight. END
BEGIN NOW Boosed at five
o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby,
14A. END
BEGIN NOW Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing
time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter
out of teacups. END
BEGIN NOW And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph
Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in
Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new
testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. END
BEGIN NOW And the two
shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody
fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls
screeching laughing at one another. END
BEGIN NOW HOW IS YOUR TESTAMENT? END
BEGIN NOW HAVE YOU
GOT AN OLD TESTAMENT? END
BEGIN NOW Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. END
BEGIN NOW Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and
she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots
on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. END
BEGIN NOW Jack Mooney's sister. END
BEGIN NOW And the old prostitute of a mother
procuring rooms to street couples. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, Jack made him toe the line. END
BEGIN NOW Told
him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him. END
BEGIN NOW So Terry brought the three pints. END
BEGIN NOW --Here, says Joe, doing the honours. END
BEGIN NOW Here, citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --SLAN LEAT, says he. END
BEGIN NOW --Fortune, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW Good health, citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. END
BEGIN NOW Want a
small fortune to keep him in drinks. END
BEGIN NOW --Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Friend of yours, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --Nannan? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW The mimber? END
BEGIN NOW --I won't mention any names, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --I thought so, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW I saw him up at that meeting now with William
Field, M. P., the cattle traders. END
BEGIN NOW --Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all
countries and the idol of his own. END
BEGIN NOW So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and
the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending
them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the
scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy
for timber tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. END
BEGIN NOW Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are
coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a
grazier. END
BEGIN NOW Mister Knowall. END
BEGIN NOW Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. END
BEGIN NOW Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of
tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches
of fat all over her. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye
was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. END
BEGIN NOW What's your programme
today? END
BEGIN NOW Ay. END
BEGIN NOW Humane methods. END
BEGIN NOW Because the poor animals suffer and experts
say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and
on the sore spot administer gently. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a
hen. END
BEGIN NOW Ga Ga Gara. END
BEGIN NOW Klook Klook Klook. END
BEGIN NOW Black Liz is our hen. END
BEGIN NOW She lays eggs
for us. END
BEGIN NOW When she lays her egg she is so glad. END
BEGIN NOW Gara. END
BEGIN NOW Klook Klook Klook. END
BEGIN NOW Then comes good uncle Leo. END
BEGIN NOW He puts his hand under black Liz and takes
her fresh egg. END
BEGIN NOW Ga ga ga ga Gara. END
BEGIN NOW Klook Klook Klook. END
BEGIN NOW --Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London
to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons. END
BEGIN NOW --Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to see him,
as it happens. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight. END
BEGIN NOW --That's too bad, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW I wanted particularly. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps only Mr Field
is going. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't phone. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW You're sure? END
BEGIN NOW --Nannan's going too, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW The league told him to ask a question
tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the
park. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think of that, citizen? END
BEGIN NOW THE SLUAGH NA H-EIREANN. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. END
BEGIN NOW Nat. END
BEGIN NOW ): Arising out of the question of my
honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right
honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these
animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as
to their pathological condition? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. END
BEGIN NOW Con. END
BEGIN NOW ): Honourable members are already in
possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. END
BEGIN NOW I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. END
BEGIN NOW The answer to the
honourable member's question is in the affirmative. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. END
BEGIN NOW Nat. END
BEGIN NOW ): Have similar orders been issued for
the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the
Phoenix park? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous
Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury
bench? END
BEGIN NOW (O! END
BEGIN NOW O!) END
BEGIN NOW Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. END
BEGIN NOW Ind. END
BEGIN NOW ): Don't hesitate to shoot. END
BEGIN NOW (Ironical opposition cheers.) END
BEGIN NOW The speaker: Order! END
BEGIN NOW Order! END
BEGIN NOW (The house rises. END
BEGIN NOW Cheers.) END
BEGIN NOW --There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. END
BEGIN NOW There he
is sitting there. END
BEGIN NOW The man that got away James Stephens. END
BEGIN NOW The champion of
all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. END
BEGIN NOW What was your best throw,
citizen? END
BEGIN NOW --NA BACLEIS, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. END
BEGIN NOW There was a time
I was as good as the next fellow anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW --Put it there, citizen, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW You were and a bloody sight better. END
BEGIN NOW --Is that really a fact? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW That's well known. END
BEGIN NOW Did you not know that? END
BEGIN NOW So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn
tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and
building up a nation once again and all to that. END
BEGIN NOW And of course Bloom had
to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent
exercise was bad. END
BEGIN NOW I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a
straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: LOOK AT, BLOOM. END
BEGIN NOW DO YOU SEE THAT STRAW? END
BEGIN NOW THAT'S A STRAW. END
BEGIN NOW Declare to my aunt he'd talk
about it for an hour so he would and talk steady. END
BEGIN NOW A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of BRIAN
O'CIARNAIN'S in SRAID NA BRETAINE BHEAG, under the auspices of SLUAGH NA
H-EIREANN, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of
physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and
ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. END
BEGIN NOW The venerable president
of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large
dimensions. END
BEGIN NOW After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent
oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and
instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence
ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient
games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. END
BEGIN NOW The
wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old
tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for
the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes,
practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the
best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from
ancient ages. END
BEGIN NOW L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and
hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the
discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty
plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy
rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily
too familiar to need recalling here) A NATION ONCE AGAIN in the execution
of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of
contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. END
BEGIN NOW The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi
was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the
greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen
can sing it. END
BEGIN NOW His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality
greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously
applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many
prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press
and the bar and the other learned professions. END
BEGIN NOW The proceedings then
terminated. END

BEGIN NOW --Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett
match? END
BEGIN NOW --No, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --Who? END
BEGIN NOW Blazes? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And says Bloom:

--What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the
eye. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, Blazes, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up
the odds and he swatting all the time. END
BEGIN NOW --We know him, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW The traitor's son. END
BEGIN NOW We know what put
English gold in his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW ---True for you, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the
blood, asking Alf:

--Now, don't you think, Bergan? END
BEGIN NOW --Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Heenan and Sayers was only a
bloody fool to it. END
BEGIN NOW Handed him the father and mother of a beating. END
BEGIN NOW See the
little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. END
BEGIN NOW God, he gave
him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke
what he never ate. END
BEGIN NOW It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were
scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. END
BEGIN NOW Handicapped
as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by
superlative skill in ringcraft. END
BEGIN NOW The final bout of fireworks was a
gruelling for both champions. END
BEGIN NOW The welterweight sergeantmajor had
tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh
had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman
putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on
looking groggy. END
BEGIN NOW The soldier got to business, leading off with a
powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting
out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. END
BEGIN NOW The redcoat
ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being
a fine one. END
BEGIN NOW The men came to handigrips. END
BEGIN NOW Myler quickly became busy and got
his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler
punishing him. END
BEGIN NOW The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took
his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell
went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the
fistic Eblanite in jigtime. END
BEGIN NOW It was a fight to a finish and the best man
for it. END
BEGIN NOW The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. END
BEGIN NOW The
referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky
and his footwork a treat to watch. END
BEGIN NOW After a brisk exchange of courtesies
during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely
from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and
landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. END
BEGIN NOW It was a knockout clean and clever. END
BEGIN NOW Amid tense expectation the Portobello
bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein
threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied
cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him
with delight. END
BEGIN NOW --He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW I hear he's running
a concert tour now up in the north. END
BEGIN NOW --He is, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't he? END
BEGIN NOW --Who? END
BEGIN NOW says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, yes. END
BEGIN NOW That's quite true. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, a kind of summer tour,
you see. END
BEGIN NOW Just a holiday. END
BEGIN NOW --Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --My wife? END
BEGIN NOW says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW She's singing, yes. END
BEGIN NOW I think it will be a success
too. END
BEGIN NOW He's an excellent man to organise. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent. END
BEGIN NOW Hoho begob says I to myself says I. END
BEGIN NOW That explains the milk in the cocoanut
and absence of hair on the animal's chest. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes doing the tootle on the
flute. END
BEGIN NOW Concert tour. END
BEGIN NOW Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that
sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. END

BEGIN NOW And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero
of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in
the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert. END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, Ned. END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW --Hello, Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --God save you, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --Save you kindly, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW What'll it be, Ned? END
BEGIN NOW --Half one, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW So J. J. ordered the drinks. END
BEGIN NOW --Were you round at the court? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW He'll square that, Ned, says he. END
BEGIN NOW --Hope so, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Now what were those two at? END
BEGIN NOW J. J. getting him off the grand jury list
and the other give him a leg over the stile. END
BEGIN NOW With his name in Stubbs's. END
BEGIN NOW Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their
eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. END
BEGIN NOW Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would
know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his
boots out of the pop. END
BEGIN NOW What's your name, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Dunne, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, and done
says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm
thinking. END
BEGIN NOW --Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW U. p: up. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW Looking for a private detective. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only
Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined
first. END
BEGIN NOW --Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW God, I'd give anything to hear
him before a judge and jury. END
BEGIN NOW --Was it you did it, Alf? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW The truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson. END
BEGIN NOW --Me? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character. END
BEGIN NOW --Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence
against you. END
BEGIN NOW --Of course an action would lie, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW It implies that he is not
COMPOS MENTIS. END
BEGIN NOW U. p: up. END
BEGIN NOW --COMPOS your eye! END
BEGIN NOW says Alf, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know that he's balmy? END
BEGIN NOW Look at his head. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on
with a shoehorn. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment
for publishing it in the eyes of the law. END
BEGIN NOW --Ha ha, Alf, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife. END
BEGIN NOW --Pity about her, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Or any other woman marries a half and
half. END
BEGIN NOW --How half and half? END
BEGIN NOW says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Do you mean he ...

--Half and half I mean, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW A fellow that's neither fish nor
flesh. END
BEGIN NOW --Nor good red herring, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --That what's I mean, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW A pishogue, if you know what that
is. END
BEGIN NOW Begob I saw there was trouble coming. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom explaining he meant on
account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the
old stuttering fool. END
BEGIN NOW Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody
povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,
bringing down the rain. END
BEGIN NOW And she with her nose cockahoop after she married
him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. END
BEGIN NOW Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the
signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy
Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. END
BEGIN NOW And who was he, tell
us? END
BEGIN NOW A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and
he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world. END
BEGIN NOW --And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. END
BEGIN NOW It was held to be
sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. END
BEGIN NOW In my
opinion an action might lie. END
BEGIN NOW Six and eightpence, please. END
BEGIN NOW Who wants your opinion? END
BEGIN NOW Let us drink
our pints in peace. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, good health, Jack, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW --Good health, Ned, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW ---There he is again, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Where? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his
oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking
in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a
secondhand coffin. END
BEGIN NOW --How did that Canada swindle case go off? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Remanded, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James
Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying
he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Do you see any green
in the white of my eye? END
BEGIN NOW Course it was a bloody barney. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Swindled
them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own
kidney too. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or
something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the
holy Moses he was stuck for two quid. END
BEGIN NOW --Who tried the case? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Recorder, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW --Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes. END
BEGIN NOW --Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in
tears on the bench. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock
the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the
corporation there near Butt bridge. END
BEGIN NOW And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:

--A most scandalous thing! END
BEGIN NOW This poor hardworking man! END
BEGIN NOW How many
children? END
BEGIN NOW Ten, did you say? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, your worship. END
BEGIN NOW And my wife has the typhoid. END
BEGIN NOW --And the wife with typhoid fever! END
BEGIN NOW Scandalous! END
BEGIN NOW Leave the court
immediately, sir. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. END
BEGIN NOW How dare you,
sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! END
BEGIN NOW A poor hardworking
industrious man! END
BEGIN NOW I dismiss the case. END
BEGIN NOW And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in
the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first
quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the
halls of law. END
BEGIN NOW There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber,
gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury
in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the
first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will
propounded and final testamentary disposition IN RE the real and
personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased,
versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. END
BEGIN NOW And to the
solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. END
BEGIN NOW And he
sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the
brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in
and for the county of the city of Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW And there sat with him the high
sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the
tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of
the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of
Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of
the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of
Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good
men and true. END
BEGIN NOW And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that
they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the
issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at
the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God
and kiss the book. END
BEGIN NOW And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and
they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do
His rightwiseness. END
BEGIN NOW And straightway the minions of the law led forth from
their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in
consequence of information received. END
BEGIN NOW And they shackled him hand and foot
and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against
him for he was a malefactor. END
BEGIN NOW --Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland
filling the country with bugs. END
BEGIN NOW So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling
him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he
would just say a word to Mr Crawford. END
BEGIN NOW And so Joe swore high and holy by
this and by that he'd do the devil and all. END
BEGIN NOW --Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have
repetition. END
BEGIN NOW That's the whole secret. END
BEGIN NOW --Rely on me, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW We
want no more strangers in our house. END
BEGIN NOW --O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW It's just that
Keyes, you see. END
BEGIN NOW --Consider that done, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Very kind of you, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW --The strangers, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Our own fault. END
BEGIN NOW We let them come in. END
BEGIN NOW We
brought them in. END
BEGIN NOW The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon
robbers here. END
BEGIN NOW --Decree NISI, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and
when. END
BEGIN NOW --A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our
misfortunes. END
BEGIN NOW --And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the POLICE GAZETTE
with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint. END
BEGIN NOW --Give us a squint at her, says I. END
BEGIN NOW And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry
borrows off of Corny Kelleher. END
BEGIN NOW Secrets for enlarging your private parts. END
BEGIN NOW Misconduct of society belle. END
BEGIN NOW Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago
contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. END
BEGIN NOW Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for
her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in
time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor. END
BEGIN NOW --O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is! END
BEGIN NOW --There's hair, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of
that one, what? END
BEGIN NOW So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a
face on him as long as a late breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? END
BEGIN NOW What
did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about
the Irish language? END
BEGIN NOW O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the
puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that
which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city,
second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due
prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel
whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour
among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael. END
BEGIN NOW --It's on the march, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW To hell with the bloody brutal
Sassenachs and their PATOIS. END
BEGIN NOW So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till
you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your
blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a
nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and
their colonies and their civilisation. END
BEGIN NOW --Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW To hell with them! END
BEGIN NOW The
curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged
sons of whores' gets! END
BEGIN NOW No music and no art and no literature worthy of the
name. END
BEGIN NOW Any civilisation they have they stole from us. END
BEGIN NOW Tonguetied sons of
bastards' ghosts. END
BEGIN NOW --The European family, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW ...

--They're not European, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW I was in Europe with Kevin Egan
of Paris. END
BEGIN NOW You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in
Europe except in a CABINET D'AISANCE. END
BEGIN NOW And says John Wyse:

--Full many a flower is born to blush unseen. END
BEGIN NOW And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:

--CONSPUEZ LES ANGLAIS! END
BEGIN NOW PERFIDE ALBION! END
BEGIN NOW He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands
the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan LAMH
DEARG ABU, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous
heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the
deathless gods. END
BEGIN NOW --What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW You look like a fellow that had
lost a bob and found a tanner. END
BEGIN NOW --Gold cup, says he. END
BEGIN NOW --Who won, Mr Lenehan? END
BEGIN NOW says Terry. END
BEGIN NOW --THROWAWAY, says he, at twenty to one. END
BEGIN NOW A rank outsider. END
BEGIN NOW And the rest
nowhere. END
BEGIN NOW --And Bass's mare? END
BEGIN NOW says Terry. END
BEGIN NOW --Still running, says he. END
BEGIN NOW We're all in a cart. END
BEGIN NOW Boylan plunged two quid on
my tip SCEPTRE for himself and a lady friend. END
BEGIN NOW --I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on ZINFANDEL that Mr Flynn gave
me. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Howard de Walden's. END
BEGIN NOW --Twenty to one, says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Such is life in an outhouse. END
BEGIN NOW THROWAWAY,
says he. END
BEGIN NOW Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. END
BEGIN NOW Frailty, thy name
is SCEPTRE. END
BEGIN NOW So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck
with his mangy snout up. END
BEGIN NOW Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard. END
BEGIN NOW --Not there, my child, says he. END
BEGIN NOW --Keep your pecker up, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW She'd have won the money only for the
other dog. END
BEGIN NOW And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom
sticking in an odd word. END
BEGIN NOW --Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't
see the beam in their own. END
BEGIN NOW --RAIMEIS, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW There's no-one as blind as the fellow that
won't see, if you know what that means. END
BEGIN NOW Where are our missing
twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four,
our lost tribes? END
BEGIN NOW And our potteries and textiles, the finest in
the whole world! END
BEGIN NOW And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time
of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim
and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass
down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since
Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory
raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in
the whole wide world. END
BEGIN NOW Where are the Greek merchants that came through the
pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with
gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? END
BEGIN NOW Read
Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. END
BEGIN NOW Wine, peltries,
Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed
horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering
to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. END
BEGIN NOW What do the
yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? END
BEGIN NOW And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions
of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption? END
BEGIN NOW --As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland
with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. END
BEGIN NOW Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. END
BEGIN NOW I was
reading a report of lord Castletown's ...

--Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain
elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. END
BEGIN NOW Save the
trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of
Eire, O. END
BEGIN NOW --Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon
at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief
ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine
Valley. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,
Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs
Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss
Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche
Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla
Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa
San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss
Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs
Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs
Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their
presence. END
BEGIN NOW The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of
the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green
mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a
yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued
fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn
bronze. END
BEGIN NOW The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer,
sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a
dainty MOTIF of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and
repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron
feathers of paletinted coral. END
BEGIN NOW Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the
organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed
numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement
of WOODMAN, SPARE THAT TREE at the conclusion of the service. END
BEGIN NOW On
leaving the church of Saint Fiacre IN HORTO after the papal
blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire
of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod,
hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. END
BEGIN NOW Mr and Mrs Wyse
Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest. END
BEGIN NOW --And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW We had our trade with
Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway. END
BEGIN NOW --And will again, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the
citizen, clapping his thigh. END
BEGIN NOW our harbours that are empty will be full
again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of
Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet
of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the
O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. END
BEGIN NOW And will again, says he, when the
first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to
the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat,
the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue
field, the three sons of Milesius. END
BEGIN NOW And he took the last swig out of the pint. END
BEGIN NOW Moya. END
BEGIN NOW All wind and piss like
a tanyard cat. END
BEGIN NOW Cows in Connacht have long horns. END
BEGIN NOW As much as his bloody
life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled
multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly
Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the
holding of an evicted tenant. END
BEGIN NOW --Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW What will you have? END
BEGIN NOW --An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion. END
BEGIN NOW --Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. END
BEGIN NOW Terry! END
BEGIN NOW Are you asleep? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir, says Terry. END
BEGIN NOW Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. END
BEGIN NOW Right, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead
of attending to the general public. END
BEGIN NOW Picture of a butting match, trying to
crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down
like a bull at a gate. END
BEGIN NOW And another one: BLACK BEAST BURNED IN OMAHA, GA.
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung
up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, they ought
to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure
of their job. END
BEGIN NOW --But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay? END
BEGIN NOW --I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Hell upon earth it is. END
BEGIN NOW Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the
training ships at Portsmouth. END
BEGIN NOW A fellow writes that calls himself DISGUSTED
ONE. END
BEGIN NOW So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew
of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the
parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad
brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a
gun. END
BEGIN NOW --A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the
breech. END
BEGIN NOW And says John Wyse:

--'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance. END
BEGIN NOW Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long
cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad
till he yells meila murder. END
BEGIN NOW --That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the
earth. END
BEGIN NOW The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on
the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs
and cottonball barons. END
BEGIN NOW That's the great empire they boast about of drudges
and whipped serfs. END
BEGIN NOW --On which the sun never rises, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. END
BEGIN NOW The
unfortunate yahoos believe it. END
BEGIN NOW They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,
and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,
born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified,
flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again
from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further
orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid. END
BEGIN NOW --But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW I mean wouldn't
it be the same here if you put force against force? END
BEGIN NOW Didn't I tell you? END
BEGIN NOW As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his
last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living. END
BEGIN NOW --We'll put force against force, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW We have our greater
Ireland beyond the sea. END
BEGIN NOW They were driven out of house and home in the
black 47. END
BEGIN NOW Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid
low by the batteringram and the TIMES rubbed its hands and told the
whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as
redskins in America. END
BEGIN NOW Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. END
BEGIN NOW But the
Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of
crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, they
drove out the peasants in hordes. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty thousand of them died in the
coffinships. END
BEGIN NOW But those that came to the land of the free remember the
land of bondage. END
BEGIN NOW And they will come again and with a vengeance, no
cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan. END
BEGIN NOW --Perfectly true, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW But my point was ...

--We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Since the
poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at
Killala. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us
against the Williamites and they betrayed us. END
BEGIN NOW Remember Limerick and the
broken treatystone. END
BEGIN NOW We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild
geese. END
BEGIN NOW Fontenoy, eh? END
BEGIN NOW And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in
Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. END
BEGIN NOW But what did we ever get for it? END
BEGIN NOW --The French! END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Set of dancing masters! END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what
it is? END
BEGIN NOW They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Aren't they
trying to make an ENTENTE CORDIALE now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with
perfidious Albion? END
BEGIN NOW Firebrands of Europe and they always were. END
BEGIN NOW --CONSPUEZ LES FRANCAIS, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer. END
BEGIN NOW --And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had
enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the
elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead? END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one
with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of
God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her
up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers
and singing him old bits of songs about EHREN ON THE RHINE and come where
the boose is cheaper. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW We have Edward the peacemaker now. END
BEGIN NOW --Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW There's a bloody sight more pox
than pax about that boyo. END
BEGIN NOW Edward Guelph-Wettin! END
BEGIN NOW --And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and
bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's
racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys
rode. END
BEGIN NOW The earl of Dublin, no less. END
BEGIN NOW --They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
Alf. END
BEGIN NOW And says J. J.:

--Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision. END
BEGIN NOW --Will you try another, citizen? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, sir, says he. END
BEGIN NOW I will. END
BEGIN NOW --You? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Beholden to you, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW May your shadow never grow less. END
BEGIN NOW --Repeat that dose, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with
his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about. END
BEGIN NOW --Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. END
BEGIN NOW Perpetuating national hatred among nations. END
BEGIN NOW --But do you know what a nation means? END
BEGIN NOW says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW --What is it? END
BEGIN NOW says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW --A nation? END
BEGIN NOW says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW A nation is the same people living in the same
place. END
BEGIN NOW --By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm
living in the same place for the past five years. END
BEGIN NOW So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to
muck out of it:

--Or also living in different places. END
BEGIN NOW --That covers my case, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --What is your nation if I may ask? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --Ireland, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW I was born here. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner. END
BEGIN NOW --After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to
swab himself dry. END
BEGIN NOW --Here you are, citizen, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Take that in your right hand and repeat
after me the following words. END
BEGIN NOW The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish
facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og
MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully
produced and called forth prolonged admiration. END
BEGIN NOW No need to dwell on the
legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can
distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each
of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North
American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it
said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. END
BEGIN NOW The
scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths
and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones,
are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the

BEGIN NOW This very instant. END

auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle. END
BEGIN NOW --Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW --Right, says John Wyse. END

to John Wyse. END

BEGIN NOW Just a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Who's hindering you? END
BEGIN NOW And off he pops like greased lightning. END

BEGIN NOW --Well, says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't that what we're told. END
BEGIN NOW Love your neighbour. END

BEGIN NOW More power, citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --Hurrah, there, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle. END
BEGIN NOW --We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. END
BEGIN NOW What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women
and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text GOD IS LOVE
pasted round the mouth of his cannon? END
BEGIN NOW The bible! END
BEGIN NOW Did you read that skit in
the UNITED IRISHMAN today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England? END
BEGIN NOW --What's that? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts
reading out:

--A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented
yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting,
Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt
thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his
dominions. END
BEGIN NOW The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion
of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech,
freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias
Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and
emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the
British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest
possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God
and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by
the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal
dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. END
BEGIN NOW The Alaki then drank a
lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast BLACK AND WHITE from the
skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak,
surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of
Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently
executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he
swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl
hands. END
BEGIN NOW --Widow woman, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't doubt her. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder did he put that
bible to the same use as I would. END
BEGIN NOW --Same only more so, says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW And thereafter in that fruitful land
the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly. END
BEGIN NOW --Is that by Griffith? END
BEGIN NOW says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW --No, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW It's not signed Shanganagh. END
BEGIN NOW It's only
initialled: P.

--And a very good initial too, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --That's how it's worked, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Trade follows the flag. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo
Free State they must be bad. END
BEGIN NOW Did you read that report by a man what's this
his name is? END
BEGIN NOW --Casement, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW He's an Irishman. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging
the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of
them. END
BEGIN NOW --I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW --Who? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW --Bloom, says he. END
BEGIN NOW The courthouse is a blind. END
BEGIN NOW He had a few bob on
THROWAWAY and he's gone to gather in the shekels. END
BEGIN NOW --Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen, that never backed a horse
in anger in his life? END
BEGIN NOW --That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW I met Bantam Lyons going to back
that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. END
BEGIN NOW Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. END
BEGIN NOW He's the only
man in Dublin has it. END
BEGIN NOW A dark horse. END
BEGIN NOW --He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Mind, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW Show us the entrance out. END
BEGIN NOW --There you are, says Terry. END
BEGIN NOW Goodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. END
BEGIN NOW So I just went round the back of
the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was
letting off my (THROWAWAY twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to
myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in
Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is
five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke
was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must
have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube
SHE'S BETTER or SHE'S (ow!) END
BEGIN NOW all a plan so he could vamoose with the
pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) END
BEGIN NOW Ireland my nation says he (hoik! END
BEGIN NOW phthook!) END
BEGIN NOW never be up to those
bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) END
BEGIN NOW cuckoos. END
BEGIN NOW So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse
saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his
paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes
off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk
about selling Irish industries. END
BEGIN NOW Robbing Peter to pay Paul. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, that puts
the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. END
BEGIN NOW Give us
a bloody chance. END
BEGIN NOW God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody
mouseabout. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. END
BEGIN NOW And his old fellow before him
perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that
poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with
his baubles and his penny diamonds. END
BEGIN NOW Loans by post on easy terms. END
BEGIN NOW Any
amount of money advanced on note of hand. END
BEGIN NOW Distance no object. END
BEGIN NOW No security. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with
every one. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW And there's the man now that'll tell
you all about it, Martin Cunningham. END
BEGIN NOW Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power
with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the
collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration
and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the
king's expense. END
BEGIN NOW Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their
palfreys. END
BEGIN NOW --Ho, varlet! END
BEGIN NOW cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. END
BEGIN NOW Saucy knave! END
BEGIN NOW To us! END
BEGIN NOW So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice. END
BEGIN NOW Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard. END
BEGIN NOW --Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow. END
BEGIN NOW --Bestir thyself, sirrah! END
BEGIN NOW cried he who had knocked. END
BEGIN NOW Look to our steeds. END
BEGIN NOW And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it. END
BEGIN NOW --Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
larder. END
BEGIN NOW I know not what to offer your lordships. END
BEGIN NOW --How now, fellow? END
BEGIN NOW cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun? END
BEGIN NOW An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage. END
BEGIN NOW --Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. END
BEGIN NOW An you be the king's
messengers (God shield His Majesty!) END
BEGIN NOW you shall not want for aught. END
BEGIN NOW The
king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) END
BEGIN NOW shall not go afasting in my house
I warrant me. END
BEGIN NOW --Then about! END
BEGIN NOW cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman
by his aspect. END
BEGIN NOW Hast aught to give us? END
BEGIN NOW Mine host bowed again as he made answer:

--What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head
with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of
old Rhenish? END
BEGIN NOW --Gadzooks! END
BEGIN NOW cried the last speaker. END
BEGIN NOW That likes me well. END
BEGIN NOW Pistachios! END
BEGIN NOW --Aha! END
BEGIN NOW cried he of the pleasant countenance. END
BEGIN NOW A poor house and a bare
larder, quotha! END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis a merry rogue. END
BEGIN NOW So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW --Where is he? END
BEGIN NOW says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Defrauding widows and orphans. END
BEGIN NOW --Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about
Bloom and the Sinn Fein? END
BEGIN NOW --That's so, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW Or so they allege. END
BEGIN NOW --Who made those allegations? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW --I, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW I'm the alligator. END
BEGIN NOW --And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the
next fellow? END
BEGIN NOW --Why not? END
BEGIN NOW says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is. END
BEGIN NOW --Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell
is he? END
BEGIN NOW says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Or who is he? END
BEGIN NOW No offence, Crofton. END
BEGIN NOW --Who is Junius? END
BEGIN NOW says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW --We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian. END
BEGIN NOW --He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he
drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. END
BEGIN NOW We know that in
the castle. END
BEGIN NOW --Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? END
BEGIN NOW says Jack Power. END
BEGIN NOW --Not at all, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW Only namesakes. END
BEGIN NOW His name was Virag, the
father's name that poisoned himself. END
BEGIN NOW He changed it by deedpoll, the father
did. END
BEGIN NOW --That's the new Messiah for Ireland! END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Island of saints
and sages! END
BEGIN NOW --Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW For that
matter so are we. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their
Messiah. END
BEGIN NOW And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till
he knows if he's a father or a mother. END
BEGIN NOW --Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW --O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his
that died was born. END
BEGIN NOW I met him one day in the south city markets buying a
tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered. END
BEGIN NOW --EN VENTRE SA MERE, says J. J. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you call that a man? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power. END
BEGIN NOW --And who does he suspect? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. END
BEGIN NOW One of those mixed
middlings he is. END
BEGIN NOW Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month
with headache like a totty with her courses. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what I'm telling
you? END
BEGIN NOW It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and
throw him in the bloody sea. END
BEGIN NOW Justifiable homicide, so it would. END
BEGIN NOW Then
sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a
man. END
BEGIN NOW Give us your blessing. END
BEGIN NOW Not as much as would blind your eye. END
BEGIN NOW --Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW But where is he? END
BEGIN NOW We can't wait. END
BEGIN NOW --A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW That's what he is. END
BEGIN NOW Virag
from Hungary! END
BEGIN NOW Ahasuerus I call him. END
BEGIN NOW Cursed by God. END
BEGIN NOW --Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? END
BEGIN NOW says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW --Only one, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW We must be quick. END
BEGIN NOW J. J. and S.

--You, Jack? END
BEGIN NOW Crofton? END
BEGIN NOW Three half ones, Terry. END
BEGIN NOW --Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,
says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our
shores. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. END
BEGIN NOW God bless all here is my
prayer. END
BEGIN NOW --Amen, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --And I'm sure He will, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes,
thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons,
the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians
and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and
Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans,
and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi,
Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel
mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of
Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis,
capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara:
and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent:
and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the
confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother
Edmund Ignatius Rice. END
BEGIN NOW And after came all saints and martyrs,

BEGIN NOW And all came with nimbi and
aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive
crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their
efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees,
bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons,
lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles,
stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps,
stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax
candles, aspergills, unicorns. END
BEGIN NOW And as they wended their way by Nelson's
Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street
chanting the introit in EPIPHANIA DOMINI which beginneth SURGE,
ILLUMINARE and thereafter most sweetly the gradual OMNES which saith
DE SABA VENIENT they did divers wonders such as casting out devils,
raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the
blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting
and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. END
BEGIN NOW And last, beneath
a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by
Malachi and Patrick. END
BEGIN NOW And when the good fathers had reached the appointed
place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little
Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for
the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the
celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the
groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments
and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas
and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God
might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac
and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. END
BEGIN NOW And
entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all
the blessed answered his prayers. END
BEGIN NOW --ADIUTORIUM NOSTRUM IN NOMINE DOMINI. END
BEGIN NOW --QUI FECIT COELUM ET TERRAM. END
BEGIN NOW --DOMINUS VOBISCUM. END
BEGIN NOW --ET CUM SPIRITU TUO. END
BEGIN NOW And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he
prayed and they all with him prayed:

--DEUS, CUIUS VERBO SANCTIFICANTUR OMNIA, BENEDICTIONEM TUAM EFFUNDE SUPER
CREATURAS ISTAS: ET PRAESTA UT QUISQUIS EIS SECUNDUM LEGEM ET VOLUNTATEM

BEGIN NOW --And so say all of us, says Jack. END
BEGIN NOW --Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford. END
BEGIN NOW --Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. END
BEGIN NOW And butter for fish. END
BEGIN NOW I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike
when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a
hurry. END
BEGIN NOW --I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. END
BEGIN NOW I hope I'm
not ...

--No, says Martin, we're ready. END
BEGIN NOW Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. END
BEGIN NOW Mean bloody scut. END
BEGIN NOW Stand us a drink itself. END
BEGIN NOW Devil a sweet fear! END
BEGIN NOW There's
a jew for you! END
BEGIN NOW All for number one. END
BEGIN NOW Cute as a shithouse rat. END
BEGIN NOW Hundred to
five. END
BEGIN NOW --Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,

--Beg your pardon, says he. END
BEGIN NOW --Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. END
BEGIN NOW Come along now. END
BEGIN NOW --Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. END
BEGIN NOW It's a
secret. END
BEGIN NOW And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl. END
BEGIN NOW --Bye bye all, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or
whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all
at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car. END
BEGIN NOW ---Off with you, says

Martin to the jarvey. END
BEGIN NOW The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop
the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward
with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. END
BEGIN NOW A many comely nymphs drew
nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble
bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when
he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each
one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and
giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend
for the smile of ladies fair. END
BEGIN NOW Even so did they come and set them, those
willing nymphs, the undying sisters. END
BEGIN NOW And they laughed, sporting in a
circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves. END
BEGIN NOW But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the
citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the
dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle
in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round
him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him. END
BEGIN NOW --Let me alone, says he. END
BEGIN NOW And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he
bawls out of him:

--Three cheers for Israel! END
BEGIN NOW Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ'
sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, there's
always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about
bloody nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would. END
BEGIN NOW And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin
telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and
Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the
loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down
on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye
starts singing IF THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS A JEW, JEW, JEW and a slut
shouts out of her:

--Eh, mister! END
BEGIN NOW Your fly is open, mister! END
BEGIN NOW And says he:

--Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. END
BEGIN NOW And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. END
BEGIN NOW Your God. END
BEGIN NOW --He had no father, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW That'll do now. END
BEGIN NOW Drive ahead. END
BEGIN NOW --Whose God? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW --Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Your God was a jew. END
BEGIN NOW Christ was a jew
like me. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop. END
BEGIN NOW --By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy
name. END
BEGIN NOW By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. END
BEGIN NOW Give us that biscuitbox here. END
BEGIN NOW --Stop! END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from
the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid
farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander
Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the
distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of
Murmuring Waters). END
BEGIN NOW The ceremony which went off with great ECLAT was
characterised by the most affecting cordiality. END
BEGIN NOW An illuminated scroll of
ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the
distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the
community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully
executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects
every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob AGUS Jacob. END
BEGIN NOW The departing guest
was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present
being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the
wellknown strains of COME BACK TO ERIN, followed immediately by RAKOCZSY'S
MARCH. END
BEGIN NOW Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four
seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf,
Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and
Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks
of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Amid
cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big
muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the
mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral
tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large
numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of
barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in

BEGIN NOW Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin
anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he
shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal
theatre:

--Where is he till I murder him? END
BEGIN NOW And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing. END
BEGIN NOW --Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel. END

into the county Longford. END

after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing
and the old tinbox clattering along the street. END
BEGIN NOW The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. END
BEGIN NOW The

seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the

ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,
two roods and one square pole or perch. END
BEGIN NOW All the lordly residences in
the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble
edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important
legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath
which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. END
BEGIN NOW From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves
were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic
character. END

respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk
umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms
and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter
sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered
by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former
on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded
to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen
bay near the old head of Kinsale. END

observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through
the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed
southwest by west. END

The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
embrace. END
BEGIN NOW Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all
too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on
the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the
quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the
voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the
stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea. END
BEGIN NOW The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. END
BEGIN NOW Many a time and oft
were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat
beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and
Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky
Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to
match and the name H.M.S. END
BEGIN NOW Belleisle printed on both. END
BEGIN NOW For Tommy and
Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled
twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry
faces and endearing ways about them. END
BEGIN NOW They were dabbling in the sand with
their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with
their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. END
BEGIN NOW And Edy Boardman was
rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young
gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. END
BEGIN NOW He was but eleven months and nine
days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his
first babyish words. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat
little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin. END
BEGIN NOW --Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. END
BEGIN NOW Say out big, big. END
BEGIN NOW I want a drink of
water. END
BEGIN NOW And baby prattled after her:

--A jink a jink a jawbo. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,
so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to
take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and
promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup
on. END
BEGIN NOW What a persuasive power that girl had! END
BEGIN NOW But to be sure baby Boardman
was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. END
BEGIN NOW None of
your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey. END
BEGIN NOW A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in
her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a
girl lovable in the extreme. END
BEGIN NOW And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint
language of little brother. END
BEGIN NOW But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy
and Master Jacky. END
BEGIN NOW Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception
to this golden rule. END
BEGIN NOW The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong
that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the
Martello tower had. END
BEGIN NOW But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was
selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's house
is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the
wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) END
BEGIN NOW the coveted castle
too. END
BEGIN NOW Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the
attention of the girl friends. END
BEGIN NOW --Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. END
BEGIN NOW At once! END
BEGIN NOW And you,
Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. END
BEGIN NOW Wait till I catch
you for that. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for
their big sister's word was law with the twins. END
BEGIN NOW And in a sad plight he was
too after his misadventure. END
BEGIN NOW His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables
were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing
over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was
to be seen on his smart little suit. END
BEGIN NOW Still the blue eyes were glistening
with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and
shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near
him she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition. END
BEGIN NOW --Nasty bold Jacky! END
BEGIN NOW she cried. END
BEGIN NOW She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:

--What's your name? END
BEGIN NOW Butter and cream? END
BEGIN NOW --Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. END
BEGIN NOW Is Cissy your
sweetheart? END
BEGIN NOW --Nao, tearful Tommy said. END
BEGIN NOW --Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? END
BEGIN NOW Cissy queried. END
BEGIN NOW --Nao, Tommy said. END
BEGIN NOW --I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from
her shortsighted eyes. END
BEGIN NOW I know who is Tommy's sweetheart. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty is
Tommy's sweetheart. END
BEGIN NOW --Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered
to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the
gentleman couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes. END
BEGIN NOW But who was Gerty? END
BEGIN NOW Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in
thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a
specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. END
BEGIN NOW She was
pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she
was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. END
BEGIN NOW Her figure was slight and graceful,
inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of
late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch's
female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get
and that tired feeling. END
BEGIN NOW The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual
in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid's
bow, Greekly perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Her hands were of finely veined alabaster
with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments
could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves
in bed or take a milk footbath either. END
BEGIN NOW Bertha Supple told that once
to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers
drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs
from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to
let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she'd never
speak to her again. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Honour where honour is due. END
BEGIN NOW There was an
innate refinement, a languid queenly HAUTEUR about Gerty which
was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. END
BEGIN NOW Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in
her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education
Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the
land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and
patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs
to her. END
BEGIN NOW Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to
her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,
that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm
few could resist. END
BEGIN NOW Why have women such eyes of witchery? END
BEGIN NOW Gerty's were of
the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive
brows. END
BEGIN NOW Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. END
BEGIN NOW It was
Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess
Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that
haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and
she had never regretted it. END
BEGIN NOW Then there was blushing scientifically cured
and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but
your nose? END
BEGIN NOW That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. END
BEGIN NOW But
Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. END
BEGIN NOW It was dark brown
with a natural wave in it. END
BEGIN NOW She had cut it that very morning on account
of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of
luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. END
BEGIN NOW And just
now at Edy's words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest
rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish
shyness that of a surety God's fair land of Ireland did not hold
her equal. END
BEGIN NOW For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. END
BEGIN NOW She was
about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Inclination
prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. END
BEGIN NOW The pretty lips
pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little
laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. END
BEGIN NOW She knew
right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him
cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers' quarrel. END
BEGIN NOW As per
usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle
off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her
window. END
BEGIN NOW Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying
hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was
going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left
the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the
bicycle races in Trinity college university. END
BEGIN NOW Little recked he perhaps
for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,
piercing to the core. END
BEGIN NOW Yet he was young and perchance he might
learn to love her in time. END
BEGIN NOW They were protestants in his family
and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed
Virgin and then Saint Joseph. END
BEGIN NOW But he was undeniably handsome with an
exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the
shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know
anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at
the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those
good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and
that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because
he didn't go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of
Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be
out. END
BEGIN NOW A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it
was expected in the LADY'S PICTORIAL that electric blue would be worn)
with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket
(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a
navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful
figure to perfection. END
BEGIN NOW She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of
wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue
chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. END
BEGIN NOW All Tuesday
week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last
she found what she wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly
shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. END
BEGIN NOW She
did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then,
smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! END
BEGIN NOW And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that
would take the shine out of some people she knew. END
BEGIN NOW Her shoes were the
newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very
PETITE but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never
would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over
her higharched instep. END
BEGIN NOW Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect
proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of
her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide
garter tops. END
BEGIN NOW As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who that knows
the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would
never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? END
BEGIN NOW She had
four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and
nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons,
rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself
and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them
and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't trust
those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things. END
BEGIN NOW She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own
colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere
on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because
his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition
and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was
dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out
and that was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things on
inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long
as it wasn't of a Friday. END
BEGIN NOW And yet and yet! END
BEGIN NOW That strained look on her face! END
BEGIN NOW A gnawing sorrow is
there all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds
to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to
tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough not
too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. END
BEGIN NOW You are
lovely, Gerty, it said. END
BEGIN NOW The paly light of evening falls upon a face
infinitely sad and wistful. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, she had
known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been
arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D.
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in
the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous
confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. END
BEGIN NOW He was
too young to understand. END
BEGIN NOW He would not believe in love, a woman's
birthright. END
BEGIN NOW The night of the party long ago in Stoer's (he was still in
short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist
she went white to the very lips. END
BEGIN NOW He called her little one in a strangely
husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) END
BEGIN NOW but it was only the end
of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about
refreshments. END
BEGIN NOW Impetuous fellow! END
BEGIN NOW Strength of character had never been Reggy
Wylie's strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be
a man among men. END
BEGIN NOW But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap
year too and would soon be over. END
BEGIN NOW No prince charming is her beau ideal to
lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a
strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly
flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering
arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature
and comfort her with a long long kiss. END
BEGIN NOW It would be like heaven. END
BEGIN NOW For such
a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. END
BEGIN NOW With all the heart of her she
longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness
in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward. END
BEGIN NOW And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
little wife to be. END
BEGIN NOW Then they could talk about her till they went blue in
the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would
be twentytwo in November. END
BEGIN NOW She would care for him with creature comforts
too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that
feeling of hominess. END
BEGIN NOW Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and
queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from
all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the
fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream
the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn't like
the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she
wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like violets or roses and
they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and
engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's lovely dog
Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the
chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer jumble sales like they
have in rich houses. END
BEGIN NOW He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always
admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his
carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent
for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) END
BEGIN NOW and then, when they settled
down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they
would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two
selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little
wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so
then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run
off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. END
BEGIN NOW But Tommy
said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the
ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was
his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you
please. END
BEGIN NOW The temper of him! END
BEGIN NOW O, he was a man already was little Tommy
Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. END
BEGIN NOW Edy told him no, no and to be off now
with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him. END
BEGIN NOW --You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. END
BEGIN NOW It's my ball. END
BEGIN NOW But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her
finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and
Tommy after it in full career, having won the day. END
BEGIN NOW --Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss. END
BEGIN NOW And she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played here's
the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread carriage
and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. END
BEGIN NOW But Edy
got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from
everyone always petting him. END
BEGIN NOW --I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't say. END
BEGIN NOW --On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy
saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her
life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure
the gentleman opposite heard what she said. END
BEGIN NOW But not a pin cared Ciss. END
BEGIN NOW --Let him! END
BEGIN NOW she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her
nose. END
BEGIN NOW Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at him. END
BEGIN NOW Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. END
BEGIN NOW You had to laugh at her
sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW For instance when she asked you would you have some more
Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's
faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she
wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to
the Miss White. END
BEGIN NOW That was just like Cissycums. END
BEGIN NOW O, and will you ever forget
her the evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned
cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW There was none to come up to her for fun. END
BEGIN NOW But she was sincerity itself,
one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your
twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome. END
BEGIN NOW And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the
pealing anthem of the organ. END
BEGIN NOW It was the men's temperance retreat conducted
by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and
benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. END
BEGIN NOW They were there gathered
together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying
spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,
after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of
the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto,
beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words,
holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. END
BEGIN NOW How sad to poor Gerty's ears! END
BEGIN NOW Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by
taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson's
Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. END
BEGIN NOW Over and
over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown
study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing
out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty
bucket, thinking. END
BEGIN NOW But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths
and homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, she had even
witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and
had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget
himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty
knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of
kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low. END
BEGIN NOW And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
Virgin most merciful. END
BEGIN NOW And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her
companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off
Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like
himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. END
BEGIN NOW You never saw him
any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a
father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it
was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples
on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. END
BEGIN NOW Poor father! END
BEGIN NOW With all his faults she loved him still when he sang TELL ME, MARY, HOW TO
WOO THEE or MY LOVE AND COTTAGE NEAR ROCHELLE and they had stewed cockles
and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for supper and when he sang THE
MOON HATH RAISED with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God
have mercy on him, from a stroke. END
BEGIN NOW Her mother's birthday that was and
Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and
Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken. END
BEGIN NOW No-one would have thought the end was so near. END
BEGIN NOW Now he was laid to rest. END
BEGIN NOW And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of
his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on account of the gout and
she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his
office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a
palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home. END
BEGIN NOW A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house,
a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. END
BEGIN NOW And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it
rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't like
her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing
they ever had words about, taking snuff. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone thought the world of her
for her gentle ways. END
BEGIN NOW It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every
night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she
never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer's
christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in
the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a
bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice
window. END
BEGIN NOW You could see there was a story behind it. END
BEGIN NOW The colours were done
something lovely. END
BEGIN NOW She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude
and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. END
BEGIN NOW She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain
purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with
the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out
in Walker's pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap
about the halcyon days what they meant. END
BEGIN NOW The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at
last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting
behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down
towards the seaweedy rocks. END
BEGIN NOW Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to
voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there
by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. END
BEGIN NOW Our two
champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble
Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. END
BEGIN NOW The
gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand
towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under
Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock. END
BEGIN NOW The twins clamoured again
for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so
Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn't come
rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy
laughed. END
BEGIN NOW --If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. END
BEGIN NOW A delicate pink crept into her
pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her
skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly
good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards
the shingle. END
BEGIN NOW Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention
on account of the gentleman opposite looking. END
BEGIN NOW She felt the warm flush, a
danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her
cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but
now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face
that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed
to her the saddest she had ever seen. END
BEGIN NOW Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and
with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of
original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for
us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. END
BEGIN NOW And careworn
hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred
and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with
hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great
saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin's
intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who
implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her. END
BEGIN NOW The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy Caffrey played with
baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. END
BEGIN NOW Peep
she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy
gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! END
BEGIN NOW and, my word,
didn't the little chap enjoy that! END
BEGIN NOW And then she told him to say papa. END
BEGIN NOW --Say papa, baby. END
BEGIN NOW Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.

And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health,
a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be
something great, they said. END
BEGIN NOW --Haja ja ja haja. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit
up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out,
holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket
the other way under him. END
BEGIN NOW Of course his infant majesty was most
obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:

--Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa. END
BEGIN NOW And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW It was all no
use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the
geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him
in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was
quickly appeased. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of
that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats
of twins. END
BEGIN NOW She gazed out towards the distant sea. END
BEGIN NOW It was like the paintings
that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such
a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the
clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like
that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a
kind of waft. END
BEGIN NOW And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it was her
he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes burned into
her as though they would search her through and through, read her very
soul. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust
them? END
BEGIN NOW People were so queer. END
BEGIN NOW She could see at once by his dark eyes and his
pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she
had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she
preferred because she wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that
wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she
could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly RETROUSSE from
where he was sitting. END
BEGIN NOW He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the
story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. END
BEGIN NOW She would have given
worlds to know what it was. END
BEGIN NOW He was looking up so intently, so still, and
he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles
of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. END
BEGIN NOW She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings
thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. END
BEGIN NOW Here was that of
which she had so often dreamed. END
BEGIN NOW It was he who mattered and there was joy
on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he
was like no-one else. END
BEGIN NOW The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her
dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. END
BEGIN NOW If he had
suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been
himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. END
BEGIN NOW Even if he was a protestant
or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. END
BEGIN NOW There
were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. END
BEGIN NOW She was a womanly woman
not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists
showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to know all, to
forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget
the memory of the past. END
BEGIN NOW Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a
real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie,
for herself alone. END
BEGIN NOW Refuge of sinners. END
BEGIN NOW Comfortress of the afflicted. END
BEGIN NOW ORA PRO NOBIS. END
BEGIN NOW Well
has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can
never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the
afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass
windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the
blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O'Hanlon at
the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. END
BEGIN NOW He looked
almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and
his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun
in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena
of Saint Dominic. END
BEGIN NOW He told her that time when she told him about that in
confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see,
not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were
all subject to nature's laws, he said, in this life and that that was no
sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said,
and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done
unto me according to Thy Word. END
BEGIN NOW He was so kind and holy and often and often
she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered
floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she
noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out
of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the
flowers for the forty hours' adoration because it was hard to know what
sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of
Dublin or some place. END
BEGIN NOW The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. END
BEGIN NOW Little
monkeys common as ditchwater. END
BEGIN NOW Someone ought to take them and give them
a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of
them. END
BEGIN NOW And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they
were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned. END
BEGIN NOW --Jacky! END
BEGIN NOW Tommy! END
BEGIN NOW Not they! END
BEGIN NOW What a great notion they had! END
BEGIN NOW So Cissy said it was the very
last time she'd ever bring them out. END
BEGIN NOW She jumped up and called them and she
ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good
enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry
she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow long because it
wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. END
BEGIN NOW She ran
with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up her skirt at
the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy
about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought
she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runner
she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat
running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. END
BEGIN NOW It would have
served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally
on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look
tall and got a fine tumble. END
BEGIN NOW TABLEAU! END
BEGIN NOW That would have been a very charming
expose for a gentleman like that to witness. END
BEGIN NOW Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,
they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed
the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the
Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was
itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't because
she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in
all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never
took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed the thurible
back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament
and the choir began to sing the TANTUM ERGO and she just swung her foot
in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the TANTUMER GOSA
CRAMEN TUM. END
BEGIN NOW Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow's
of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there
wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent,
and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form
(the cheek of her!) END
BEGIN NOW because he had eyes in his head to see the difference
for himself. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel
tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a
fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging
like a caricature. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her
hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on
a girl's shoulders--a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in
its sweetness. END
BEGIN NOW You would have to travel many a long mile before you found
a head of hair the like of that. END
BEGIN NOW She could almost see the swift answering
flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. END
BEGIN NOW She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and
swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the
expression in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. END
BEGIN NOW Her
woman's instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the
thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour
of her face became a glorious rose. END
BEGIN NOW Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,
half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the
baby. END
BEGIN NOW Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why
no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of
hers. END
BEGIN NOW And she said to Gerty:

--A penny for your thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW --What? END
BEGIN NOW replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. END
BEGIN NOW I was only wondering was it late. END
BEGIN NOW Because she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and their
babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a
gentle hint about its being late. END
BEGIN NOW And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the
time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing
time, time to kiss again. END
BEGIN NOW But Edy wanted to know because they were told to
be in early. END
BEGIN NOW --Wait, said Cissy, I'll run ask my uncle Peter over there what's the time
by his conundrum. END
BEGIN NOW So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
watchchain, looking up at the church. END
BEGIN NOW Passionate nature though he was
Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. END
BEGIN NOW One moment he
had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the
next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed
in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it
and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his
watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun
was set. END
BEGIN NOW His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in
measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said
his waterworks were out of order. END
BEGIN NOW Then they sang the second verse of the TANTUM ERGO and Canon
O'Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and
he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire
to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she
could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and
she swung her leg more in and out in time. END
BEGIN NOW It was getting darker but he
could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or
whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back
into his pockets. END
BEGIN NOW She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and
she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays
that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she
clipped her hair on account of the moon. END
BEGIN NOW His dark eyes fixed themselves
on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her
shrine. END
BEGIN NOW If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man's passionate
gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face. END
BEGIN NOW It is for you,
Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it. END
BEGIN NOW Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty
noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because
it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up
the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied their hair to
make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood up with his
cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read
off and he read out PANEM DE COELO PRAESTITISTI EIS and Edy and Cissy were
talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay
them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness
when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her
over. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty winced sharply. END
BEGIN NOW A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that
spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. END
BEGIN NOW It hurt--O yes, it cut deep because
Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound
like the confounded little cat she was. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty's lips parted swiftly to
frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat,
so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist
might have dreamed of. END
BEGIN NOW She had loved him better than he knew. END
BEGIN NOW Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never
understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was
in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes were
probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in
sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see. END
BEGIN NOW --O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head
flashed up. END
BEGIN NOW I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year. END
BEGIN NOW Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. END
BEGIN NOW There was that in her young
voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. END
BEGIN NOW As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just
chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she
cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard
into a dozen pieces. END
BEGIN NOW And if ever after he dared to presume she
could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him
shrivel up on the spot. END
BEGIN NOW Miss puny little Edy's countenance fell to
no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as
thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the
little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy
and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere,
that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else
too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe
and smoke it. END
BEGIN NOW Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy
tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too
because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. END
BEGIN NOW And
Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go
deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful
eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and
baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all
and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib. END
BEGIN NOW --O my! END
BEGIN NOW Puddeny pie! END
BEGIN NOW protested Ciss. END
BEGIN NOW He has his bib destroyed. END
BEGIN NOW The slight CONTRETEMPS claimed her attention but in two twos she set
that little matter to rights. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and
Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was
flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it
off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because
just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore
because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father
Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed
Sacrament in his hands. END
BEGIN NOW How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of
Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat
flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a
tiny lost cry. END
BEGIN NOW And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so
picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was
easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his
rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady
Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her
window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that
book THE LAMPLIGHTER by Miss Cummins, author of MABEL VAUGHAN and
other tales. END
BEGIN NOW For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. END
BEGIN NOW She loved to
read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely
confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she
laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err
on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. END
BEGIN NOW It was there
she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her
child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her
alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came
home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written
in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely's of Dame Street for
she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express
herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had
copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. END
BEGIN NOW ART
THOU REAL, MY IDEAL? END
BEGIN NOW it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and
after there was something about TWILIGHT, WILT THOU EVER? END
BEGIN NOW and ofttimes
the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted
her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping
by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she
need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey
hill and she always tried to conceal it. END
BEGIN NOW But it must end, she felt. END
BEGIN NOW If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding
back for her. END
BEGIN NOW Love laughs at locksmiths. END
BEGIN NOW She would make the great
sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW Dearer than
the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. END
BEGIN NOW There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a
married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the
nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put
into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. END
BEGIN NOW But even if--what then? END
BEGIN NOW Would it
make a very great difference? END
BEGIN NOW From everything in the least indelicate her
finebred nature instinctively recoiled. END
BEGIN NOW She loathed that sort of person,
the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went
with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl's honour,
degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. END
BEGIN NOW No, no: not
that. END
BEGIN NOW They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister
without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big
ess. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days
beyond recall. END
BEGIN NOW She thought she understood. END
BEGIN NOW She would try to understand
him because men were so different. END
BEGIN NOW The old love was waiting, waiting
with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Heart
of mine! END
BEGIN NOW She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart
that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world
for her for love was the master guide. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing else mattered. END
BEGIN NOW Come what
might she would be wild, untrammelled, free. END
BEGIN NOW Canon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle
and genuflected and the choir sang LAUDATE DOMINUM OMNES GENTES and
then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and
Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn't
she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:

--O, look, Cissy! END
BEGIN NOW And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over
the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple. END
BEGIN NOW --It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said. END
BEGIN NOW And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the
church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and
Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running. END
BEGIN NOW --Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. END
BEGIN NOW It's the bazaar fireworks. END
BEGIN NOW But Gerty was adamant. END
BEGIN NOW She had no intention of being at their beck and
call. END
BEGIN NOW If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could
see from where she was. END
BEGIN NOW The eyes that were fastened upon her set
her pulses tingling. END
BEGIN NOW She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,
and a light broke in upon her. END
BEGIN NOW Whitehot passion was in that face, passion
silent as the grave, and it had made her his. END
BEGIN NOW At last they were left
alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of
inflexible honour to his fingertips. END
BEGIN NOW His hands and face were working
and a tremour went over her. END
BEGIN NOW She leaned back far to look up where
the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not
to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and
her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that,
supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting
of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion
of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead
secret and made her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that was
staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures
cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he
used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in
the bed. END
BEGIN NOW But this was altogether different from a thing like that
because there was all the difference because she could almost feel
him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his
handsome lips. END
BEGIN NOW Besides there was absolution so long as you didn't
do the other thing before being married and there ought to be
women priests that would understand without your telling out and
Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look
in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad
about actors' photographs and besides it was on account of that other
thing coming on the way it did. END
BEGIN NOW And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back
and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they
all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned
back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying
through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. END
BEGIN NOW And she saw a long Roman
candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush,
they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher
and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,
high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine,
an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other
things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin,
better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,
on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then
it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in
every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view
high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading
and she wasn't ashamed and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way
like that because he couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment
half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen
looking and he kept on looking, looking. END
BEGIN NOW She would fain have cried to him
chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his
lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little
strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. END
BEGIN NOW And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! END
BEGIN NOW then the Roman
candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! END
BEGIN NOW and everyone cried O! END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW in
raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and
they shed and ah! END
BEGIN NOW they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden,
O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! END
BEGIN NOW Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW She
glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of
piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl
He was leaning back against the rock behind. END
BEGIN NOW Leopold Bloom (for it is he)
stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. END
BEGIN NOW What a
brute he had been! END
BEGIN NOW At it again? END
BEGIN NOW A fair unsullied soul had called to him
and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? END
BEGIN NOW An utter cad he had been! END
BEGIN NOW He of all men! END
BEGIN NOW But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,
for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and
wandered. END
BEGIN NOW Should a girl tell? END
BEGIN NOW No, a thousand times no. END
BEGIN NOW That was their
secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to
know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening
to and fro and little bats don't tell. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show
what a great person she was: and then she cried:

--Gerty! END
BEGIN NOW Gerty! END
BEGIN NOW We're going. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW We can see from farther up. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. END
BEGIN NOW She slipped a hand into
her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course
without letting him and then slipped it back. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if he's too far to. END
BEGIN NOW She rose. END
BEGIN NOW Was it goodbye? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW She had to go but they would meet again,
there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of
yester eve. END
BEGIN NOW She drew herself up to her full height. END
BEGIN NOW Their souls met in a
last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a
strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. END
BEGIN NOW She half
smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on
tears, and then they parted. END
BEGIN NOW Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to
Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. END
BEGIN NOW It was
darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy
seaweed. END
BEGIN NOW She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but
with care and very slowly because--because Gerty MacDowell was ... END
BEGIN NOW Tight boots? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW She's lame! END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. END
BEGIN NOW Poor girl! END
BEGIN NOW That's why she's left
on the shelf and the others did a sprint. END
BEGIN NOW Thought something was wrong by
the cut of her jib. END
BEGIN NOW Jilted beauty. END
BEGIN NOW A defect is ten times worse in a woman. END
BEGIN NOW But makes them polite. END
BEGIN NOW Glad I didn't know it when she was on show. END
BEGIN NOW Hot
little devil all the same. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't mind. END
BEGIN NOW Curiosity like a nun or a
negress or a girl with glasses. END
BEGIN NOW That squinty one is delicate. END
BEGIN NOW Near her
monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. END
BEGIN NOW I have such a bad headache
today. END
BEGIN NOW Where did I put the letter? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, all right. END
BEGIN NOW All kinds of crazy
longings. END
BEGIN NOW Licking pennies. END
BEGIN NOW Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told
me liked to smell rock oil. END
BEGIN NOW Virgins go mad in the end I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Sister? END
BEGIN NOW How many women in Dublin have it today? END
BEGIN NOW Martha, she. END
BEGIN NOW Something
in the air. END
BEGIN NOW That's the moon. END
BEGIN NOW But then why don't all women menstruate
at the same time with the same moon, I mean? END
BEGIN NOW Depends on the time
they were born I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Or all start scratch then get out of step. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes Molly and Milly together. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow I got the best of that. END
BEGIN NOW Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her silly
I will punish you letter. END
BEGIN NOW Made up for that tramdriver this morning. END
BEGIN NOW That gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. END
BEGIN NOW And his wife
engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. END
BEGIN NOW Thankful for small
mercies. END
BEGIN NOW Cheap too. END
BEGIN NOW Yours for the asking. END
BEGIN NOW Because they want it themselves. END
BEGIN NOW Their natural craving. END
BEGIN NOW Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices. END
BEGIN NOW Reserve better. END
BEGIN NOW Don't want it they throw it at you. END
BEGIN NOW Catch em alive, O. END
BEGIN NOW Pity they can't see themselves. END
BEGIN NOW A dream of wellfilled hose. END
BEGIN NOW Where was
that? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. END
BEGIN NOW Peeping
Tom. END
BEGIN NOW Willy's hat and what the girls did with it. END
BEGIN NOW Do they snapshot
those girls or is it all a fake? END
BEGIN NOW LINGERIE does it. END
BEGIN NOW Felt for the
curves inside her DESHABILLE. END
BEGIN NOW Excites them also when they're. END
BEGIN NOW I'm all
clean come and dirty me. END
BEGIN NOW And they like dressing one another for the
sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW Milly delighted with Molly's new blouse. END
BEGIN NOW At first. END
BEGIN NOW Put them all on to take them all off. END
BEGIN NOW Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Why I bought her the violet
garters. END
BEGIN NOW Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. END
BEGIN NOW He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. END
BEGIN NOW His lovely
shirt was shining beneath his what? END
BEGIN NOW of jet. END
BEGIN NOW Say a woman loses a charm with
every pin she takes out. END
BEGIN NOW Pinned together. END
BEGIN NOW O, Mairy lost the pin of her. END
BEGIN NOW Dressed up to the nines for somebody. END
BEGIN NOW Fashion part of their charm. END
BEGIN NOW Just
changes when you're on the track of the secret. END
BEGIN NOW Except the east: Mary,
Martha: now as then. END
BEGIN NOW No reasonable offer refused. END
BEGIN NOW She wasn't in a hurry
either. END
BEGIN NOW Always off to a fellow when they are. END
BEGIN NOW They never forget an
appointment. END
BEGIN NOW Out on spec probably. END
BEGIN NOW They believe in chance because like
themselves. END
BEGIN NOW And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. END
BEGIN NOW Girl friends
at school, arms round each other's necks or with ten fingers locked,
kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. END
BEGIN NOW Nuns
with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down,
vindictive too for what they can't get. END
BEGIN NOW Barbed wire. END
BEGIN NOW Be sure now and write
to me. END
BEGIN NOW And I'll write to you. END
BEGIN NOW Now won't you? END
BEGIN NOW Molly and Josie Powell. END
BEGIN NOW Till
Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon. END
BEGIN NOW TABLEAU! END
BEGIN NOW O, look
who it is for the love of God! END
BEGIN NOW How are you at all? END
BEGIN NOW What have you been
doing with yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. END
BEGIN NOW Picking
holes in each other's appearance. END
BEGIN NOW You're looking splendid. END
BEGIN NOW Sister souls. END
BEGIN NOW Showing their teeth at one another. END
BEGIN NOW How many have you left? END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't lend
each other a pinch of salt. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Devils they are when that's coming on them. END
BEGIN NOW Dark devilish appearance. END
BEGIN NOW Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. END
BEGIN NOW Scratch the sole of
my foot. END
BEGIN NOW O that way! END
BEGIN NOW O, that's exquisite! END
BEGIN NOW Feel it myself too. END
BEGIN NOW Good to rest
once in a way. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. END
BEGIN NOW Safe in one way. END
BEGIN NOW Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. END
BEGIN NOW Something about withering plants I
read in a garden. END
BEGIN NOW Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she's a
flirt. END
BEGIN NOW All are. END
BEGIN NOW Daresay she felt 1. END
BEGIN NOW When you feel like that you often meet
what you feel. END
BEGIN NOW Liked me or what? END
BEGIN NOW Dress they look at. END
BEGIN NOW Always know a fellow
courting: collars and cuffs. END
BEGIN NOW Well cocks and lions do the same and stags. END
BEGIN NOW Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. END
BEGIN NOW Trousers? END
BEGIN NOW Suppose I
when I was? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Gently does it. END
BEGIN NOW Dislike rough and tumble. END
BEGIN NOW Kiss in the dark
and never tell. END
BEGIN NOW Saw something in me. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder what. END
BEGIN NOW Sooner have me as I am
than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his
dexter optic. END
BEGIN NOW To aid gentleman in literary. END
BEGIN NOW Ought to attend to my
appearance my age. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't let her see me in profile. END
BEGIN NOW Still, you
never know. END
BEGIN NOW Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. END
BEGIN NOW Beauty and the
beast. END
BEGIN NOW Besides I can't be so if Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Took off her hat to show
her hair. END
BEGIN NOW Wide brim. END
BEGIN NOW Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might
know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. END
BEGIN NOW Hair
strong in rut. END
BEGIN NOW Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when we were on
the rocks in Holles street. END
BEGIN NOW Why not? END
BEGIN NOW Suppose he gave her money. END
BEGIN NOW Why not? END
BEGIN NOW All a prejudice. END
BEGIN NOW She's worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW I
think so. END
BEGIN NOW All that for nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Bold hand: Mrs Marion. END
BEGIN NOW Did I forget to
write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? END
BEGIN NOW And the
day I went to Drimmie's without a necktie. END
BEGIN NOW Wrangle with Molly it was put
me off. END
BEGIN NOW No, I remember. END
BEGIN NOW Richie Goulding: he's another. END
BEGIN NOW Weighs on his mind. END
BEGIN NOW Funny my watch stopped at half past four. END
BEGIN NOW Dust. END
BEGIN NOW Shark liver oil they use
to clean. END
BEGIN NOW Could do it myself. END
BEGIN NOW Save. END
BEGIN NOW Was that just when he, she? END
BEGIN NOW O, he did. END
BEGIN NOW Into her. END
BEGIN NOW She did. END
BEGIN NOW Done. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. END
BEGIN NOW O Lord, that little
limping devil. END
BEGIN NOW Begins to feel cold and clammy. END
BEGIN NOW Aftereffect not pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW Still you have to get rid of it someway. END
BEGIN NOW They don't care. END
BEGIN NOW Complimented
perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the
kiddies. END
BEGIN NOW Well, aren't they? END
BEGIN NOW See her as she is spoil all. END
BEGIN NOW Must have the
stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. END
BEGIN NOW The name too. END
BEGIN NOW AMOURS
of actresses. END
BEGIN NOW Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. END
BEGIN NOW Curtain up. END
BEGIN NOW Moonlight silver effulgence. END
BEGIN NOW Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. END
BEGIN NOW Little
sweetheart come and kiss me. END
BEGIN NOW Still, I feel. END
BEGIN NOW The strength it gives a man. END
BEGIN NOW That's the secret of it. END
BEGIN NOW Good job I let off there behind the wall coming
out of Dignam's. END
BEGIN NOW Cider that was. END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise I couldn't have. END
BEGIN NOW Makes you want
to sing after. END
BEGIN NOW LACAUS ESANT TARATARA. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose I spoke to her. END
BEGIN NOW What about? END
BEGIN NOW Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the conversation. END
BEGIN NOW Ask them a
question they ask you another. END
BEGIN NOW Good idea if you're stuck. END
BEGIN NOW Gain time. END
BEGIN NOW But
then you're in a cart. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and
you see she's on for it: good evening. END
BEGIN NOW O but the dark evening in the
Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. END
BEGIN NOW Whew! END
BEGIN NOW Girl in
Meath street that night. END
BEGIN NOW All the dirty things I made her say. END
BEGIN NOW All wrong of
course. END
BEGIN NOW My arks she called it. END
BEGIN NOW It's so hard to find one who. END
BEGIN NOW Aho! END
BEGIN NOW If you
don't answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. END
BEGIN NOW And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. END
BEGIN NOW Parrots. END
BEGIN NOW Press
the button and the bird will squeak. END
BEGIN NOW Wish she hadn't called me sir. END
BEGIN NOW O, her
mouth in the dark! END
BEGIN NOW And you a married man with a single girl! END
BEGIN NOW That's what
they enjoy. END
BEGIN NOW Taking a man from another woman. END
BEGIN NOW Or even hear of it. END
BEGIN NOW Different with me. END
BEGIN NOW Glad to get away from other chap's wife. END
BEGIN NOW Eating off his
cold plate. END
BEGIN NOW Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. END
BEGIN NOW French letter still in my pocketbook. END
BEGIN NOW Cause of half the trouble. END
BEGIN NOW But might
happen sometime, I don't think. END
BEGIN NOW Come in, all is prepared. END
BEGIN NOW I dreamt. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Worst is beginning. END
BEGIN NOW How they change the venue when it's not what they
like. END
BEGIN NOW Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman
who. END
BEGIN NOW Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his
mind and stopped. END
BEGIN NOW Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something
like that. END
BEGIN NOW Because I did. END
BEGIN NOW She too. END
BEGIN NOW Offend her. END
BEGIN NOW Then make it up. END
BEGIN NOW Pretend to
want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. END
BEGIN NOW Flatters them. END
BEGIN NOW She must
have been thinking of someone else all the time. END
BEGIN NOW What harm? END
BEGIN NOW Must since she
came to the use of reason, he, he and he. END
BEGIN NOW First kiss does the trick. END
BEGIN NOW The
propitious moment. END
BEGIN NOW Something inside them goes pop. END
BEGIN NOW Mushy like, tell by
their eye, on the sly. END
BEGIN NOW First thoughts are best. END
BEGIN NOW Remember that till their
dying day. END
BEGIN NOW Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall
beside the gardens. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen she told me. END
BEGIN NOW But her breasts were developed. END
BEGIN NOW Fell asleep then. END
BEGIN NOW After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. END
BEGIN NOW Featherbed mountain. END
BEGIN NOW Gnashing her teeth in sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Lord mayor had his eye
on her too. END
BEGIN NOW Val Dillon. END
BEGIN NOW Apoplectic. END
BEGIN NOW There she is with them down there for the fireworks. END
BEGIN NOW My fireworks. END
BEGIN NOW Up like a rocket, down like a stick. END
BEGIN NOW And the children, twins they must be,
waiting for something to happen. END
BEGIN NOW Want to be grownups. END
BEGIN NOW Dressing in
mother's clothes. END
BEGIN NOW Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. END
BEGIN NOW And
the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I knew she could
whistle. END
BEGIN NOW Mouth made for that. END
BEGIN NOW Like Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Why that highclass whore in
Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. END
BEGIN NOW Would you mind, please, telling
me the right time? END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you the right time up a dark lane. END
BEGIN NOW Say prunes
and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. END
BEGIN NOW Caressing the
little boy too. END
BEGIN NOW Onlookers see most of the game. END
BEGIN NOW Of course they understand
birds, animals, babies. END
BEGIN NOW In their line. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't look back when she was going down the strand. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't give that
satisfaction. END
BEGIN NOW Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. END
BEGIN NOW Fine
eyes she had, clear. END
BEGIN NOW It's the white of the eye brings that out not so much
the pupil. END
BEGIN NOW Did she know what I? END
BEGIN NOW Course. END
BEGIN NOW Like a cat sitting beyond a dog's
jump. END
BEGIN NOW Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a
picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. END
BEGIN NOW Call that innocence? END
BEGIN NOW Poor idiot! END
BEGIN NOW His wife has her work cut out for her. END
BEGIN NOW Never see them sit
on a bench marked WET PAINT. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes all over them. END
BEGIN NOW Look under the bed
for what's not there. END
BEGIN NOW Longing to get the fright of their lives. END
BEGIN NOW Sharp as needles they are. END
BEGIN NOW When I said to Molly the man at the corner
of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at
once he had a false arm. END
BEGIN NOW Had, too. END
BEGIN NOW Where do they get that? END
BEGIN NOW Typist
going up Roger Greene's stairs two at a time to show her understandings. END
BEGIN NOW Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. END
BEGIN NOW Bred in the
bone. END
BEGIN NOW Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to
save the ironing. END
BEGIN NOW Best place for an ad to catch a woman's eye on a
mirror. END
BEGIN NOW And when I sent her for Molly's Paisley shawl to Prescott's
by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! END
BEGIN NOW Clever little minx. END
BEGIN NOW I never told her. END
BEGIN NOW Neat way she carries parcels
too. END
BEGIN NOW Attract men, small thing like that. END
BEGIN NOW Holding up her hand, shaking it,
to let the blood flow back when it was red. END
BEGIN NOW Who did you learn that from? END
BEGIN NOW Nobody. END
BEGIN NOW Something the nurse taught me. END
BEGIN NOW O, don't they know! END
BEGIN NOW Three years
old she was in front of Molly's dressingtable, just before we left Lombard
street west. END
BEGIN NOW Me have a nice pace. END
BEGIN NOW Mullingar. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows? END
BEGIN NOW Ways of the
world. END
BEGIN NOW Young student. END
BEGIN NOW Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. END
BEGIN NOW Still she was game. END
BEGIN NOW Lord, I am wet. END
BEGIN NOW Devil you are. END
BEGIN NOW Swell of her calf. END
BEGIN NOW Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. END
BEGIN NOW Not like that frump
today. END
BEGIN NOW A. E. Rumpled stockings. END
BEGIN NOW Or the one in Grafton street. END
BEGIN NOW White. END
BEGIN NOW Wow! END
BEGIN NOW Beef to the heel. END
BEGIN NOW A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. END
BEGIN NOW Zrads
and zrads, zrads, zrads. END
BEGIN NOW And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see
and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the
rocks. END
BEGIN NOW Will she? END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW See! END
BEGIN NOW Looked round. END
BEGIN NOW She smelt an onion. END
BEGIN NOW Darling, I saw, your. END
BEGIN NOW I saw all. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Did me good all the same. END
BEGIN NOW Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. END
BEGIN NOW For
this relief much thanks. END
BEGIN NOW In HAMLET, that is. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW It was all things
combined. END
BEGIN NOW Excitement. END
BEGIN NOW When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my
tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Your head it simply swirls. END
BEGIN NOW He's right. END
BEGIN NOW Might have made a worse
fool of myself however. END
BEGIN NOW Instead of talking about nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Then I will tell
you all. END
BEGIN NOW Still it was a kind of language between us. END
BEGIN NOW It couldn't be? END
BEGIN NOW No,
Gerty they called her. END
BEGIN NOW Might be false name however like my name and the
address Dolphin's barn a blind. END
BEGIN NOW HER MAIDEN NAME WAS JEMINA BROWN
    AND SHE LIVED WITH HER MOTHER IN IRISHTOWN. END
BEGIN NOW Place made me think of that I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW All tarred with the same brush. END
BEGIN NOW Wiping pens in their stockings. END
BEGIN NOW But the ball rolled down to her as if it
understood. END
BEGIN NOW Every bullet has its billet. END
BEGIN NOW Course I never could throw
anything straight at school. END
BEGIN NOW Crooked as a ram's horn. END
BEGIN NOW Sad however because
it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa's
pants will soon fit Willy and fuller's earth for the baby when they hold
him out to do ah ah. END
BEGIN NOW No soft job. END
BEGIN NOW Saves them. END
BEGIN NOW Keeps them out of harm's
way. END
BEGIN NOW Nature. END
BEGIN NOW Washing child, washing corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW Children's hands
always round them. END
BEGIN NOW Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first,
sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. END
BEGIN NOW Oughtn't to have given
that child an empty teat to suck. END
BEGIN NOW Fill it up with wind. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Beaufoy,
Purefoy. END
BEGIN NOW Must call to the hospital. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is nurse Callan there still. END
BEGIN NOW She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace. END
BEGIN NOW That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. END
BEGIN NOW And Mrs Breen
and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. END
BEGIN NOW Worst of all at night
Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. END
BEGIN NOW Husband rolling in drunk, stink of
pub off him like a polecat. END
BEGIN NOW Have that in your nose in the dark,
whiff of stale boose. END
BEGIN NOW Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last
night? END
BEGIN NOW Bad policy however to fault the husband. END
BEGIN NOW Chickens come
home to roost. END
BEGIN NOW They stick by one another like glue. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe the
women's fault also. END
BEGIN NOW That's where Molly can knock spots off them. END
BEGIN NOW It's the
blood of the south. END
BEGIN NOW Moorish. END
BEGIN NOW Also the form, the figure. END
BEGIN NOW Hands felt for the
opulent. END
BEGIN NOW Just compare for instance those others. END
BEGIN NOW Wife locked up at home,
skeleton in the cupboard. END
BEGIN NOW Allow me to introduce my. END
BEGIN NOW Then they trot you out
some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. END
BEGIN NOW Always see a
fellow's weak point in his wife. END
BEGIN NOW Still there's destiny in it, falling in
love. END
BEGIN NOW Have their own secrets between them. END
BEGIN NOW Chaps that would go to the dogs
if some woman didn't take them in hand. END
BEGIN NOW Then little chits of girls,
height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. END
BEGIN NOW As God made them he
matched them. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes children turn out well enough. END
BEGIN NOW Twice nought makes
one. END
BEGIN NOW Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. END
BEGIN NOW Marry in May and
repent in December. END
BEGIN NOW This wet is very unpleasant. END
BEGIN NOW Stuck. END
BEGIN NOW Well the foreskin
is not back. END
BEGIN NOW Better detach. END
BEGIN NOW Ow! END
BEGIN NOW Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. END
BEGIN NOW Long and
the short of it. END
BEGIN NOW Big he and little she. END
BEGIN NOW Very strange about my watch. END
BEGIN NOW Wristwatches are always going wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is there any magnetic
influence between the person because that was about the time he. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I
suppose, at once. END
BEGIN NOW Cat's away, the mice will play. END
BEGIN NOW I remember looking in
Pill lane. END
BEGIN NOW Also that now is magnetism. END
BEGIN NOW Back of everything magnetism. END
BEGIN NOW Earth
for instance pulling this and being pulled. END
BEGIN NOW That causes movement. END
BEGIN NOW And
time, well that's the time the movement takes. END
BEGIN NOW Then if one thing stopped
the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. END
BEGIN NOW Because it's all arranged. END
BEGIN NOW Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the stars. END
BEGIN NOW Little
piece of steel iron. END
BEGIN NOW When you hold out the fork. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW Tip. END
BEGIN NOW Woman
and man that is. END
BEGIN NOW Fork and steel. END
BEGIN NOW Molly, he. END
BEGIN NOW Dress up and look and suggest
and let you see and see more and defy you if you're a man to see that and,
like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you. END
BEGIN NOW Tip. END
BEGIN NOW Have to let fly. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder how is she feeling in that region. END
BEGIN NOW Shame all put on before
third person. END
BEGIN NOW More put out about a hole in her stocking. END
BEGIN NOW Molly, her
underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and
spurs at the horse show. END
BEGIN NOW And when the painters were in Lombard street
west. END
BEGIN NOW Fine voice that fellow had. END
BEGIN NOW How Giuglini began. END
BEGIN NOW Smell that I did. END
BEGIN NOW Like flowers. END
BEGIN NOW It was too. END
BEGIN NOW Violets. END
BEGIN NOW Came from the turpentine probably in
the paint. END
BEGIN NOW Make their own use of everything. END
BEGIN NOW Same time doing it scraped
her slipper on the floor so they wouldn't hear. END
BEGIN NOW But lots of them can't
kick the beam, I think. END
BEGIN NOW Keep that thing up for hours. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of a general
all round over me and half down my back. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Hm. END
BEGIN NOW Hm. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW That's her perfume. END
BEGIN NOW Why she waved her hand. END
BEGIN NOW I
leave you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW Heliotrope? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Hyacinth? END
BEGIN NOW Hm. END
BEGIN NOW Roses, I think. END
BEGIN NOW She'd like scent of that
kind. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet and cheap: soon sour. END
BEGIN NOW Why Molly likes opoponax. END
BEGIN NOW Suits her,
with a little jessamine mixed. END
BEGIN NOW Her high notes and her low notes. END
BEGIN NOW At the
dance night she met him, dance of the hours. END
BEGIN NOW Heat brought it out. END
BEGIN NOW She was
wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. END
BEGIN NOW Good
conductor, is it? END
BEGIN NOW Or bad? END
BEGIN NOW Light too. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose there's some connection. END
BEGIN NOW For
instance if you go into a cellar where it's dark. END
BEGIN NOW Mysterious thing too. END
BEGIN NOW Why did I smell it only now? END
BEGIN NOW Took its time in coming like herself, slow
but sure. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it is. END
BEGIN NOW Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell
them leagues off. END
BEGIN NOW Tell you what it is. END
BEGIN NOW It's like a fine fine veil or web
they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and
they're always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow
colours without knowing it. END
BEGIN NOW Clings to everything she takes off. END
BEGIN NOW Vamp of
her stockings. END
BEGIN NOW Warm shoe. END
BEGIN NOW Stays. END
BEGIN NOW Drawers: little kick, taking them off. END
BEGIN NOW Byby till next time. END
BEGIN NOW Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on
the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Know her smell in a thousand. END
BEGIN NOW Bathwater too. END
BEGIN NOW Reminds me of
strawberries and cream. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder where it is really. END
BEGIN NOW There or the armpits
or under the neck. END
BEGIN NOW Because you get it out of all holes and corners. END
BEGIN NOW Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. END
BEGIN NOW Muskrat. END
BEGIN NOW Bag under their tails. END
BEGIN NOW One grain pour off odour for years. END
BEGIN NOW Dogs at
each other behind. END
BEGIN NOW Good evening. END
BEGIN NOW Evening. END
BEGIN NOW How do you sniff? END
BEGIN NOW Hm. END
BEGIN NOW Hm. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Animals go by that. END
BEGIN NOW Yes now, look at it that way. END
BEGIN NOW We're the same. END
BEGIN NOW Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their
period. END
BEGIN NOW Come near. END
BEGIN NOW Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. END
BEGIN NOW Like
what? END
BEGIN NOW Potted herrings gone stale or. END
BEGIN NOW Boof! END
BEGIN NOW Please keep off the grass. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps they get a man smell off us. END
BEGIN NOW What though? END
BEGIN NOW Cigary gloves long
John had on his desk the other day. END
BEGIN NOW Breath? END
BEGIN NOW What you eat and drink gives
that. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Mansmell, I mean. END
BEGIN NOW Must be connected with that because priests
that are supposed to be are different. END
BEGIN NOW Women buzz round it like flies
round treacle. END
BEGIN NOW Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. END

NOCHES, SENORITA. END
BEGIN NOW EL HOMBRE AMA LA MUCHACHA HERMOSA. END

BEGIN NOW Because
you were so foreign from the others. END

mouth. END

BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW What do you expect her to do? END

that? END

BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. END

brought it near his eyes and peered. END

BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. END
BEGIN NOW Write
a message for her. END
BEGIN NOW Might remain. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW I. END
BEGIN NOW Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Useless. END
BEGIN NOW Washed away. END

consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior
splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than

was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth

any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. END
BEGIN NOW Nine
twelve bloodflows chiding her childless. END
BEGIN NOW And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there
nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. END
BEGIN NOW And there
came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. END
BEGIN NOW And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they
had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this
learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed
for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and
dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of
volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. END
BEGIN NOW And he said now that
he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were
there. END
BEGIN NOW And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for
he was a man of cautels and a subtile. END
BEGIN NOW Also the lady was of his avis and
repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had
said thing that was false for his subtility. END
BEGIN NOW But the learningknight would
not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to
his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. END
BEGIN NOW And the traveller
Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of
limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery. END
BEGIN NOW And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of
Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they
durst not move more for enchantment. END
BEGIN NOW And on this board were frightful
swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out
of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that
there abound marvellously. END
BEGIN NOW And there were vessels that are wrought by
magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath
that he blases in to them like to bubbles. END
BEGIN NOW And full fair cheer and rich
was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. END
BEGIN NOW And there
was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay
strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this
be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. END
BEGIN NOW And these
fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because
of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. END
BEGIN NOW And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make
a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of
certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like
to a vast mountain. END
BEGIN NOW And they teach the serpents there to entwine
themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of
these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead. END
BEGIN NOW And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. END
BEGIN NOW And childe
Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in
amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and
anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his
neighbour nist not of this wile. END
BEGIN NOW And he sat down in that castle with them
for to rest him there awhile. END
BEGIN NOW Thanked be Almighty God. END
BEGIN NOW This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at
the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for
there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. END
BEGIN NOW Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that
it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not
come or now. END
BEGIN NOW Meseems it dureth overlong. END
BEGIN NOW And he was ware and saw a
franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any
of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one
emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently. END
BEGIN NOW But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and
have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. END
BEGIN NOW And the
franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next. END
BEGIN NOW Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none
asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully
delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health
for he was a passing good man of his lustiness. END
BEGIN NOW And sir Leopold
that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars' hall and
that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly
hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world
one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in
the cup. END
BEGIN NOW Woman's woe with wonder pondering. END
BEGIN NOW Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
drunken an they might. END
BEGIN NOW There was a sort of scholars along either side the
board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable's with
other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin
that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young
Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and
Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him
erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most
drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir
Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to
have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke
his avow. END
BEGIN NOW And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship
to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor
becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted
him for that time in the honourablest manner. END
BEGIN NOW Ruth red him, love led
on with will to wander, loth to leave. END
BEGIN NOW For they were right witty scholars. END
BEGIN NOW And he heard their aresouns each gen
other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that
put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a
matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house that
now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her
death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). END
BEGIN NOW And
they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said,
the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this
imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had
conscience to let her die. END
BEGIN NOW And not few and of these was young Lynch were
in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other
howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges
did provide no remedy. END
BEGIN NOW A redress God grant. END
BEGIN NOW This was scant said but all
cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live
and the babe to die. END
BEGIN NOW In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what
with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was
prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might
not lack. END
BEGIN NOW Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that
she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and
bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her
goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous
grieved. END
BEGIN NOW To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs,
is eke oft among lay folk. END
BEGIN NOW Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker,
the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. END
BEGIN NOW But, gramercy, what of
those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin
against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? END
BEGIN NOW For, sirs, he
said, our lust is brief. END
BEGIN NOW We are means to those small creatures within us
and nature has other ends than we. END
BEGIN NOW Then said Dixon junior to Punch
Costello wist he what ends. END
BEGIN NOW But he had overmuch drunken and the best word
he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she
were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of
his spleen of lustihead. END
BEGIN NOW Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young
Malachi's praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he
cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their
jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint
Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay
in man to do. END
BEGIN NOW Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen
and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange
humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that
bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. END
BEGIN NOW Then spake young Stephen orgulous
of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,
of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of
brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius
saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or
an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, EFFECTU SECUTO,
or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and
Moses Maimonides. END
BEGIN NOW He said also how at the end of the second month a human
soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for
God's greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to
bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the
fisherman's seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church
for all ages founded. END
BEGIN NOW All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would
he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. END
BEGIN NOW A
wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw,
he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who
had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also
with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that
mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such
sort deliverly he scaped their questions. END
BEGIN NOW That is truth, pardy, said
Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. END
BEGIN NOW Which hearing young Stephen was a
marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor
lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and
that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons. END
BEGIN NOW But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and
as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
could save so dark is destiny. END
BEGIN NOW And she was wondrous stricken of heart for
that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb's
wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie
akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir
Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his
friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and
as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all
accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for
young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and
murdered his goods with whores. END
BEGIN NOW About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so
as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their
approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the
intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar
of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. END
BEGIN NOW Now drink we, quod he,
of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my
body but my soul's bodiment. END
BEGIN NOW Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live
by bread alone. END
BEGIN NOW Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort
more than the other will dismay. END
BEGIN NOW See ye here. END
BEGIN NOW And he showed them
glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two
pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. END
BEGIN NOW They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as
was herebefore. END
BEGIN NOW His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he
said, time's ruins build eternity's mansions. END
BEGIN NOW What means this? END
BEGIN NOW Desire's
wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a
rose upon the rood of time. END
BEGIN NOW Mark me now. END
BEGIN NOW In woman's womb word is made
flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the
word that shall not pass away. END
BEGIN NOW This is the postcreation. END
BEGIN NOW OMNIS CARO AD TE
VENIET. END
BEGIN NOW No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse
of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most
venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an OMNIPOTENTIAM
DEIPARAE SUPPLICEM, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because
she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that
other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis
of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny
pippin. END
BEGIN NOW But here is the matter now. END
BEGIN NOW Or she knew him, that second I say,
and was but creature of her creature, VERGINE MADRE, FIGLIA DI TUO
FIGLIO, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or
ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and
with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy
marriages, PARCEQUE M. LEO TAXIL NOUS A DIT QUE QUI L'AVAIT MISE DANS

BEGIN NOW ENTWEDER
transubstantiality ODER consubstantiality but in no case
subsubstantiality. END
BEGIN NOW And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. END
BEGIN NOW A
pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without
blemish, a belly without bigness. END
BEGIN NOW Let the lewd with faith and fervour
worship. END
BEGIN NOW With will will we withstand, withsay. END
BEGIN NOW Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would
sing a bawdy catch STABOO STABELLA about a wench that was put in pod of a
jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: THE
FIRST THREE MONTHS SHE WAS NOT WELL, STABOO, when here nurse Quigley from
the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as
she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord
Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might
shorten the honour of her guard. END
BEGIN NOW It was an ancient and a sad matron of a
sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and
wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for
incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed
the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of
blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the
dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in
peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou
dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that
like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance
the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time's occasion
as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred. END
BEGIN NOW In Horne's house rest
should reign. END
BEGIN NOW To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he
had not cided to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the
womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. END
BEGIN NOW Master
Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds
and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of
a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all
intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. END
BEGIN NOW But he
said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the
eternal son and ever virgin. END
BEGIN NOW Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they
rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and
deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to
be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with
burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and
the anthem UT NOVETUR SEXUS OMNIS CORPORIS MYSTERIUM till she was there
unmaided. END
BEGIN NOW He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those
delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is
in their MAID'S TRAGEDY that was writ for a like twining of lovers: TO
BED, TO BED was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent
upon the virginals. END
BEGIN NOW An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative
suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the
paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial
communion. END
BEGIN NOW Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee,
young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth,
of such a mingling much might come. END
BEGIN NOW Young Stephen said indeed to his best
remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews
to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those
days and the custom of the country approved with it. END
BEGIN NOW Greater love than
this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend. END
BEGIN NOW Go thou and do likewise. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, or words to that effect, saith
Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the
university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was
more beholden. END
BEGIN NOW Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou
wilt have the secondbest bed. END
BEGIN NOW ORATE, FRATRES, PRO MEMETIPSO. END
BEGIN NOW And all the
people shall say, Amen. END
BEGIN NOW Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of
old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a
stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and
kick like Jeshurum. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast
made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants. END
BEGIN NOW Return, return, Clan
Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. END
BEGIN NOW Why hast thou done this abomination
before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst
deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy
daughters did lie luxuriously? END
BEGIN NOW Look forth now, my people, upon the land
of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the
Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money. END
BEGIN NOW But thou hast
suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for
ever. END
BEGIN NOW And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my
bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW This
tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined
by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from

BEGIN NOW The
adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt's plague which in the nights of
prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper UBI and QUOMODO. END
BEGIN NOW And
as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure
with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance
which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive
metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is
agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being. END
BEGIN NOW The aged sisters
draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle,
die: over us dead they bend. END
BEGIN NOW First, saved from waters of old Nile, among
bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain,
an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the
ossifrage. END

processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to
Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from
what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his
whenceness. END
BEGIN NOW Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly ETIENNE CHANSON but he loudly
bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic
longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie
order, a penny for him who finds the pea. END
BEGIN NOW BEHOLD THE MANSION REARED BY DEDAL JACK
    SEE THE MALT STORED IN MANY A REFLUENT SACK,
    IN THE PROUD CIRQUE OF JACKJOHN'S BIVOUAC. END
BEGIN NOW A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. END
BEGIN NOW Loud on
left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. END
BEGIN NOW Came now the storm
that hist his heart. END
BEGIN NOW And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and
witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. END
BEGIN NOW And
he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all
mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift
was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the
cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. END
BEGIN NOW Then did some
mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which
Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a
blow on any the least colour. END
BEGIN NOW But the braggart boaster cried that an old
Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not
lag behind his lead. END
BEGIN NOW But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he
crouched in Horne's hall. END
BEGIN NOW He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a
heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens
so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his
ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart's side,
spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it
was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of
fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the
order of a natural phenomenon. END
BEGIN NOW But was young Boasthard's fear vanquished by Calmer's words? END
BEGIN NOW No, for he
had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
done away. END
BEGIN NOW And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the
other? END
BEGIN NOW He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. END
BEGIN NOW But
could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the
bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? END
BEGIN NOW Indeed no for Grace was not
there to find that bottle. END
BEGIN NOW Heard he then in that clap the voice of the
god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? END
BEGIN NOW Heard? END
BEGIN NOW Why,
he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding
(which he had not done). END
BEGIN NOW For through that tube he saw that he was in the
land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like
the rest too a passing show. END
BEGIN NOW And would he not accept to die like the rest
and pass away? END
BEGIN NOW By no means would he though he must nor would he make more
shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them
to do by the book Law. END
BEGIN NOW Then wotted he nought of that other land which is
called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the
king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no
birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as
believe on it? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had
pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with
a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-
in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her

learned, Carnal Concupiscence. END

they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her. END

regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they
could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she
ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on
which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and
Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul
plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative
had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take
no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of
this same shield which was named Killchild. END

swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise
poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten
of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of
shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men

slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken
to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through
pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her
term, the midwives sore put to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a
bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath
very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they
say, but God give her soon issue. END

BEGIN NOW In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much
increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall
come for a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I hear that Mr
Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the
Hindustanish for his farmer's gazette) to have three things in all but
this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet
sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no
telling how. END
BEGIN NOW With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter
was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for
he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on
Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near
by which he did mighty brisk. END
BEGIN NOW He was a kind of sport gentleman that went
for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh
or hot scandal he had it pat. END
BEGIN NOW To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes
and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns
with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men, runners, flatcaps,
waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with
a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of
whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. END
BEGIN NOW He took his
ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten into him a mess of
broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he
could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had
from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of them would burst their
sides. END
BEGIN NOW The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry
or a tale. END
BEGIN NOW Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), 'tis all about
Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. END
BEGIN NOW But they can go
hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. END
BEGIN NOW There's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly
he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed
wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief
design of his embassy as he was sharpset. END
BEGIN NOW MORT AUX VACHES, says Frank
then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper
that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman
too. END
BEGIN NOW From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a
headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and
the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the
mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was
more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his
volumes. END
BEGIN NOW One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher,
then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he
was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,
kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids' linen
or choking chicken behind a hedge. END
BEGIN NOW He had been off as many times as a cat
has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father
the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. END
BEGIN NOW What,
says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift
of it, will they slaughter all? END
BEGIN NOW I protest I saw them but this day morning
going to the Liverpool boats, says he. END
BEGIN NOW I can scarce believe 'tis so bad,
says he. END
BEGIN NOW And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers,
greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for
Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock
and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. END
BEGIN NOW I
question with you there, says he. END
BEGIN NOW More like 'tis the hoose or the timber
tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such
matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler
thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor
Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two
of physic to take the bull by the horns. END
BEGIN NOW Come, come, says Mr Vincent,
plain dealing. END
BEGIN NOW He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles
with a bull that's Irish, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Irish by name and irish by nature,
says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an
English chinashop. END
BEGIN NOW I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. END
BEGIN NOW It is that same bull
that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder
of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. END
BEGIN NOW True for you, says Mr
Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a
plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. END
BEGIN NOW He had
horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out
of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and
rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. END
BEGIN NOW What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
were no better off than himself. END
BEGIN NOW So be off now, says he, and do all my
cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and
with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. END
BEGIN NOW But the slap and the
blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him
a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to
this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in
his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long
holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four
fields of all Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Another then put in his word: And they dressed
him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and
ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over
with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road
with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he
could doss and dung to his heart's content. END
BEGIN NOW By this time the father of
the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could
scarce walk to pasture. END
BEGIN NOW To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels
brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was
full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a
mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language and they all
after him. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer
nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was
the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in
the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord
Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW And, says Mr Dixon,
if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of
Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful
of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half the
countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by
lord Harry's orders. END
BEGIN NOW There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr
Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in
the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and
I'll meddle in his matters, says he. END
BEGIN NOW I'll make that animal smell hell,
says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. END
BEGIN NOW But one
evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt
to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself
but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with
pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and
on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found
sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion
bull of the Romans, BOS BOVUM, which is good bog Latin for boss of the
show. END
BEGIN NOW After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a
cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it
out again told them all his new name. END
BEGIN NOW Then, with the water running off
him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his
grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language to study but he
could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he
copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he
filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the
side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. END
BEGIN NOW In
short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse
and a shirt. END
BEGIN NOW They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of
the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of
one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of
chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang
their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head
between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly
Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their
bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. END
BEGIN NOW Which was the
occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that
rollicking chanty:


  --POPE PETER'S BUT A PISSABED. END
BEGIN NOW A MAN'S A MAN FOR A' THAT. END
BEGIN NOW Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway
as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend
whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,
who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a
cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan was civil
enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
on. END
BEGIN NOW Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend
printed in fair italics: MR MALACHI MULLIGAN. END
BEGIN NOW FERTILISER AND INCUBATOR. END
BEGIN NOW LAMBAY ISLAND. END
BEGIN NOW His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw
from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir
Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself
to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. END
BEGIN NOW Well,
let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. END
BEGIN NOW I make no doubt it
smacks of wenching. END
BEGIN NOW Come, be seated, both. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis as cheap sitting as
standing. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon
his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a
consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the
prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal
vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the
prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities
acquired. END
BEGIN NOW It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch
defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable
females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their
flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly
bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might
multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of
their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he
assured them, made his heart weep. END
BEGIN NOW To curb this inconvenient (which he
concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with
certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had
resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island
from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much
in favour with our ascendancy party. END
BEGIN NOW He proposed to set up there a
national fertilising farm to be named OMPHALOS with an obelisk hewn and
erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman
services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever
who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the
functions of her natural. END
BEGIN NOW Money was no object, he said, nor would he take
a penny for his pains. END
BEGIN NOW The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent
lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm
persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. END
BEGIN NOW For his
nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of
savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter
prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled
and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. END
BEGIN NOW After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr
Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had
shielded it. END
BEGIN NOW They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for
all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr
Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. END
BEGIN NOW His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and
won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary's excepted to it,
asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to
Newcastle. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt
quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to
him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: TALIS AC TANTA
DEPRAVATIO HUJUS SECULI, O QUIRITES, UT MATRESFAMILIARUM NOSTRAE LASCIVAS
CUJUSLIBET SEMIVIRI LIBICI TITILLATIONES TESTIBUS PONDEROSIS ATQUE
EXCELSIS ERECTIONIBUS CENTURIONUM ROMANORUM MAGNOPERE ANTEPONUNT, while
for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal
kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest
glade, the farmyard drake and duck. END
BEGIN NOW Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man
of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
advanced. END
BEGIN NOW The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
nearest neighbour. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom
were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a
civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
assistance we could give? END
BEGIN NOW Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily,
though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there
about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was in an interesting
condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh)
to know if her happiness had yet taken place. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dixon, to turn the
table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient
ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic
gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the
noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. END
BEGIN NOW For answer
Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely
below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother
Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though 'tis pity she's a
trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard. END
BEGIN NOW This was so happy a
conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into
the most violent agitations of delight. END
BEGIN NOW The spry rattle had run on in the
same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber. END
BEGIN NOW Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little
fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion
with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient
point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the
obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a
questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not
achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but
contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever
done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. END
BEGIN NOW MAIS BIEN SUR,
noble stranger, said he cheerily, ET MILLE COMPLIMENTS. END
BEGIN NOW That you may and
very opportunely. END
BEGIN NOW There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. END
BEGIN NOW But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a
cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it
in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers
above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. END
BEGIN NOW With
these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent
draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out
popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he
had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. END
BEGIN NOW Gazing upon those
features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but
beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her
dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she
told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a
tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by
generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an
enemy or to quit the field for ever. END
BEGIN NOW I declare, I was never so touched in
all my life. END
BEGIN NOW God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! END
BEGIN NOW Thrice happy
will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. END
BEGIN NOW A sigh
of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the
locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. END
BEGIN NOW Beneficent
Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal
must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free
and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the
heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. END
BEGIN NOW But indeed,
sir, I wander from the point. END
BEGIN NOW How mingled and imperfect are all our
sublunary joys. END
BEGIN NOW Maledicity! END
BEGIN NOW he exclaimed in anguish. END
BEGIN NOW Would to God that
foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! END
BEGIN NOW I could weep to
think of it. END
BEGIN NOW Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of
us a penny the worse. END
BEGIN NOW But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his
forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a
MARCHAND DE CAPOTES, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a livre as
snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. END
BEGIN NOW Tut,
tut! END
BEGIN NOW cries Le Fecondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that
most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle AVEC LUI
in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape
Horn, VENTRE BICHE, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the
stoutest cloak. END
BEGIN NOW A drenching of that violence, he tells me, SANS BLAGUE,
has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to
another world. END
BEGIN NOW Pooh! END
BEGIN NOW A LIVRE! END
BEGIN NOW cries Monsieur Lynch. END
BEGIN NOW The clumsy things are
dear at a sou. END
BEGIN NOW One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is
worth ten such stopgaps. END
BEGIN NOW No woman of any wit would wear one. END
BEGIN NOW My dear
Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she
would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me
(blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to
snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine
blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household
word that IL Y A DEUX CHOSES for which the innocence of our original
garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest,
nay, the only garment. END
BEGIN NOW The first, said she (and here my pretty
philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently
tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath
... END
BEGIN NOW But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse
which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge. END
BEGIN NOW Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while
all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,
having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a
profound bow to the company. END
BEGIN NOW The presence even for a moment among a party
of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not
less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the
most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of
ribaldry. END
BEGIN NOW Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. END
BEGIN NOW A
monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! END
BEGIN NOW I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. END
BEGIN NOW What, you dog? END
BEGIN NOW Have you a way with them? END
BEGIN NOW Gad's bud, immensely so, said Mr
Lynch. END
BEGIN NOW The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice. END
BEGIN NOW Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. END
BEGIN NOW As I
look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any
time these seven months. END
BEGIN NOW Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in
the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest
squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! END
BEGIN NOW Drat the man! END
BEGIN NOW Bless me,
I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. END
BEGIN NOW Why, you're as bad as dear little Father
Cantekissem, that you are! END
BEGIN NOW May this pot of four half choke me, cried
Costello, if she aint in the family way. END
BEGIN NOW I knows a lady what's got a
white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. END
BEGIN NOW The young surgeon, however,
rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just
then informed him that he was needed in the ward. END
BEGIN NOW Merciful providence had
been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was
ENCEINTE which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given
birth to a bouncing boy. END
BEGIN NOW I want patience, said he, with those who,
without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling
profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest
power for happiness upon the earth. END
BEGIN NOW I am positive when I say that if need
were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble
exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious
incentive in the human breast. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot away with them. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Malign such
an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the
astonishment of ours? END
BEGIN NOW And at an instant the most momentous that can
befall a puny child of clay? END
BEGIN NOW Perish the thought! END
BEGIN NOW I shudder to think of
the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and
where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of
Horne. END
BEGIN NOW Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present
on the by and repaired to the door. END
BEGIN NOW A murmur of approval arose from all
and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design
which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his
bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a
horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son
of the true fold as ever drew breath. END
BEGIN NOW Stap my vitals, said he, them was
always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most
particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to
a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on
with a loving heart. END
BEGIN NOW To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of
some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits
of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. END
BEGIN NOW The
young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown
children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly
understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous MOTS were
such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously
sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits
spoke in their behalf. END
BEGIN NOW But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome
language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a
cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and
thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the
dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as
to put him in thought of that missing link of creation's chain
desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. END
BEGIN NOW It was now for more than the
middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand
vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man
of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a
rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution,
foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds
jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. END
BEGIN NOW To
those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a
habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede
neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding:
while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there
remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to
beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. END
BEGIN NOW Not but what he could feel
with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the
gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer
expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to
pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when
she was about her lawful occasions. END
BEGIN NOW To conclude, while from the sister's
words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be
owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so
auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the
mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being. END
BEGIN NOW Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express
one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not
to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement
since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. END
BEGIN NOW The dressy
young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation or
at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. END
BEGIN NOW I must
acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a
resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again
today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a
request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. END
BEGIN NOW I bade him
hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. END
BEGIN NOW 'Slife,
I'll be round with you. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old
bucko that could still knock another child out of her. END
BEGIN NOW All fell to
praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade
held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the
man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant
vendor of articles needed in every household. END
BEGIN NOW Singular, communed the
guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis
possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting
theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere
acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of
time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art
which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. END
BEGIN NOW But, he further
added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress
them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh
together. END
BEGIN NOW But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has
this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to
civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal
polity? END
BEGIN NOW Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? END
BEGIN NOW During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with
his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to
discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will
while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? END
BEGIN NOW Has he
forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? END
BEGIN NOW Or is it that from
being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if
report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? END
BEGIN NOW Far be it from
candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of
a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue
but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his
interest not to have done) then be it so. END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy woman, she has been too
long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to
his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the
desperate. END
BEGIN NOW He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety,
who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit
intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of
society! END
BEGIN NOW Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel,
it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! END
BEGIN NOW In the question
of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe's
hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort
couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. END
BEGIN NOW It ill becomes
him to preach that gospel. END
BEGIN NOW Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies
fallow for the want of the ploughshare? END
BEGIN NOW A habit reprehensible at puberty
is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. END
BEGIN NOW If he must dispense
his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore
to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist
better with the doctrines that now engross him. END
BEGIN NOW His marital breast is the
repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. END
BEGIN NOW The lewd
suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected
and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at
his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve
and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more
temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that
comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative. END
BEGIN NOW The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior
medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation
that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women's
apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the
presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members
of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the
delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and
hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the
simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier,
broke out at once into a strife of tongues. END
BEGIN NOW In vain the voice of Mr
Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. END
BEGIN NOW The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness
which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. END
BEGIN NOW Every
phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal
repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with
respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother,
the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by
the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of
the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty
touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or
dissimulated, the acardiac FOETUS IN FOETU and aprosopia due to a
congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr
Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary
knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what
the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the
prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure
on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as
exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the
matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the
womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of
the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that
distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers STURZGEBURT,
the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births
conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a
word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in
his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. END
BEGIN NOW The gravest
problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much
animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as
the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her
movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction
upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually
entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long
usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. END
BEGIN NOW The abnormalities of
harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark
and portwine stain were alleged by one as a PRIMA FACIE and natural
hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel
Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. END
BEGIN NOW The
hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and
worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged
in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent
to the human. END
BEGIN NOW An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views,
with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation
between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own
avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the
genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of
his Metamorphoses. END
BEGIN NOW The impression made by his words was immediate but
shortlived. END
BEGIN NOW It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an
allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which
none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest
object of desire a nice clean old man. END
BEGIN NOW Contemporaneously, a heated
argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch
regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of
one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent
was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor
Deacon Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by
preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was
invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as
some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man
to put asunder what God has joined. END
BEGIN NOW But Malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. END
BEGIN NOW He conjured up the
scene before them. END
BEGIN NOW The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in
the recess appeared ... Haines! END
BEGIN NOW Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! END
BEGIN NOW He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a
phial marked POISON. END
BEGIN NOW Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all
faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. END
BEGIN NOW I anticipated some such
reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history
is to blame. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it is true. END
BEGIN NOW I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. END
BEGIN NOW And how
I am punished! END
BEGIN NOW The inferno has no terrors for me. END
BEGIN NOW This is the appearance
is on me. END
BEGIN NOW Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered
thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and
himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? END
BEGIN NOW My hell, and
Ireland's, is in this life. END
BEGIN NOW It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. END
BEGIN NOW Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum
(he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. END
BEGIN NOW In vain! END
BEGIN NOW His spectre
stalks me. END
BEGIN NOW Dope is my only hope ... Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Destruction! END
BEGIN NOW The black panther! END
BEGIN NOW With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. END
BEGIN NOW An instant later
his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row
station at ten past eleven. END
BEGIN NOW He was gone. END
BEGIN NOW Tears gushed from the eyes of
the dissipated host. END
BEGIN NOW The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The
vendetta of Mananaun! END
BEGIN NOW The sage repeated: LEX TALIONIS. END
BEGIN NOW The sentimentalist
is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a
thing done. END
BEGIN NOW Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. END
BEGIN NOW The mystery was
unveiled. END
BEGIN NOW Haines was the third brother. END
BEGIN NOW His real name was Childs. END
BEGIN NOW The
black panther was himself the ghost of his own father. END
BEGIN NOW He drank drugs to
obliterate. END
BEGIN NOW For this relief much thanks. END
BEGIN NOW The lonely house by the
graveyard is uninhabited. END
BEGIN NOW No soul will live there. END
BEGIN NOW The spider pitches her
web in the solitude. END
BEGIN NOW The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. END
BEGIN NOW A curse is on
it. END
BEGIN NOW It is haunted. END
BEGIN NOW Murderer's ground. END
BEGIN NOW What is the age of the soul of man? END
BEGIN NOW As she hath the virtue of the
chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the
merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her
mood. END
BEGIN NOW No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud
of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest
substance in the funds. END
BEGIN NOW A score of years are blown away. END
BEGIN NOW He is young
Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a
mirror (hey, presto! END
BEGIN NOW ), he beholdeth himself. END
BEGIN NOW That young figure of then is
seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house
in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him
bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's
thought. END
BEGIN NOW Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first
hard hat (ah, that was a day! END
BEGIN NOW ), already on the road, a fullfledged
traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented
handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! END
BEGIN NOW a
thing now of the past!) END
BEGIN NOW and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or
that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a
budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? END
BEGIN NOW tell me!) END
BEGIN NOW his studied
baisemoins. END
BEGIN NOW The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and
oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the
head of the firm, seated with Jacob's pipe after like labours in the
paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading
through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month
before. END
BEGIN NOW But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young
knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist. END
BEGIN NOW Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. END
BEGIN NOW Who can
say? END
BEGIN NOW The wise father knows his own child. END
BEGIN NOW He thinks of a drizzling night
in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. END
BEGIN NOW Together
(she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a
bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of
the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. END
BEGIN NOW Bridie! END
BEGIN NOW Bridie Kelly! END
BEGIN NOW He will never forget the name, ever remember the night:
first night, the bridenight. END
BEGIN NOW They are entwined in nethermost darkness,
the willer with the willed, and in an instant (FIAT!) END
BEGIN NOW light shall flood
the world. END
BEGIN NOW Did heart leap to heart? END
BEGIN NOW Nay, fair reader. END
BEGIN NOW In a breath 'twas
done but--hold! END
BEGIN NOW Back! END
BEGIN NOW It must not be! END
BEGIN NOW In terror the poor girl flees away
through the murk. END
BEGIN NOW She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. END
BEGIN NOW She
dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. END
BEGIN NOW No, Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW Name and memory
solace thee not. END
BEGIN NOW That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from
thee--and in vain. END
BEGIN NOW No son of thy loins is by thee. END
BEGIN NOW There is none now to
be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph. END
BEGIN NOW The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the
infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions
of cycles of generations that have lived. END
BEGIN NOW A region where grey twilight
ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her
dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. END
BEGIN NOW She follows her mother with
ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. END
BEGIN NOW Twilight phantoms are they,
yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a
supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. END
BEGIN NOW They fade, sad
phantoms: all is gone. END
BEGIN NOW Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls
and the sandblind upupa. END
BEGIN NOW Netaim, the golden, is no more. END
BEGIN NOW And on the
highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the
ghosts of beasts. END
BEGIN NOW Huuh! END
BEGIN NOW Hark! END
BEGIN NOW Huuh! END
BEGIN NOW Parallax stalks behind and goads
them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. END
BEGIN NOW Elk and
yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come
trooping to the sunken sea, LACUS MORTIS. END
BEGIN NOW Ominous revengeful zodiacal
host! END
BEGIN NOW They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the
trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and
crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning
multitude, murderers of the sun. END
BEGIN NOW Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. END
BEGIN NOW And the equine portent
grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own
magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. END
BEGIN NOW And lo, wonder
of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the
daystar, the bride, ever virgin. END
BEGIN NOW It is she, Martha, thou lost one,
Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. END
BEGIN NOW How serene does she now
arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour,
shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it
gossamer. END
BEGIN NOW It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it
streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents
of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling,
writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad
metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon
the forehead of Taurus. END
BEGIN NOW Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
school together in Conmee's time. END
BEGIN NOW He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
Pisistratus. END
BEGIN NOW Where were they now? END
BEGIN NOW Neither knew. END
BEGIN NOW You have spoken of the
past and its phantoms, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Why think of them? END
BEGIN NOW If I call them
into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my
call? END
BEGIN NOW Who supposes it? END
BEGIN NOW I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard,
am lord and giver of their life. END
BEGIN NOW He encircled his gadding hair with a
coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. END
BEGIN NOW That answer and those leaves,
Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and
greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father. END
BEGIN NOW All who wish you well hope this for you. END
BEGIN NOW All desire to see you bring
forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. END
BEGIN NOW I heartily
wish you may not fail them. END
BEGIN NOW O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on
the shoulder near him. END
BEGIN NOW Have no fear. END
BEGIN NOW He could not leave his mother an
orphan. END
BEGIN NOW The young man's face grew dark. END
BEGIN NOW All could see how hard it was for
him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. END
BEGIN NOW He would have
withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. END
BEGIN NOW Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider's name:
Lenehan as much more. END
BEGIN NOW He told them of the race. END
BEGIN NOW The flag fell and, huuh! END
BEGIN NOW off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with O. Madden up. END
BEGIN NOW She was leading
the field. END
BEGIN NOW All hearts were beating. END
BEGIN NOW Even Phyllis could not contain
herself. END
BEGIN NOW She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! END
BEGIN NOW Sceptre wins! END
BEGIN NOW But in the
straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse
Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. END
BEGIN NOW All was lost now. END
BEGIN NOW Phyllis
was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. END
BEGIN NOW Juno, she cried, I am undone. END
BEGIN NOW But
her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which
lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. END
BEGIN NOW A tear fell: one only. END
BEGIN NOW A
whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. END
BEGIN NOW Four winners yesterday and
three today. END
BEGIN NOW What rider is like him? END
BEGIN NOW Mount him on the camel or the
boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. END
BEGIN NOW But let us
bear it as was the ancient wont. END
BEGIN NOW Mercy on the luckless! END
BEGIN NOW Poor Sceptre! END
BEGIN NOW he
said with a light sigh. END
BEGIN NOW She is not the filly that she was. END
BEGIN NOW Never, by this
hand, shall we behold such another. END
BEGIN NOW By gad, sir, a queen of them. END
BEGIN NOW Do you
remember her, Vincent? END
BEGIN NOW I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent
said. END
BEGIN NOW How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her)
in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of
it. END
BEGIN NOW The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with
their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. END
BEGIN NOW In the sunny
patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns
with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near
the bridge. END
BEGIN NOW But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I
held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. END
BEGIN NOW A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free,
blithe, mocked at peril. END
BEGIN NOW She is more taking then. END
BEGIN NOW Her posies tool Mad
romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. END
BEGIN NOW And in
your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field. END
BEGIN NOW Conmee himself! END
BEGIN NOW He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier
book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to
keep the page. END
BEGIN NOW The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion,
feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood
clung there for the very trees adore her. END
BEGIN NOW When Conmee had passed she
glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. END
BEGIN NOW But he had
been kind. END
BEGIN NOW In going by he had blessed us. END
BEGIN NOW The gods too are ever kind,
Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW If I had poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of
his may serve me more propensely. END
BEGIN NOW He was laying his hand upon a winejar:
Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the
scarlet label. END
BEGIN NOW Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. END
BEGIN NOW His
soul is far away. END
BEGIN NOW It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision
as to be born. END
BEGIN NOW Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to
the incorruptible eon of the gods. END
BEGIN NOW Do you not think it, Stephen? END
BEGIN NOW Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence
Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. END
BEGIN NOW The lords of
the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha
of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were
therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
constellation. END
BEGIN NOW However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was. END
BEGIN NOW entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the
case at all. END
BEGIN NOW The individual whose visual organs while the above was going
on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was
as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured
the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong
shop. END
BEGIN NOW During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring
hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co
at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others
right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to
attract anyone's remark on account of its scarlet appearance. END
BEGIN NOW He was
simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known
to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the
proceedings, after the moment before's observations about boyhood days
and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own
which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. END
BEGIN NOW Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn
on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he
involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took
hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the
fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it
out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of
attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about
the place. END
BEGIN NOW The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
course of life. END
BEGIN NOW Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. END
BEGIN NOW The
debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the
loftiest and most vital. END
BEGIN NOW The high hall of Horne's house had never beheld
an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of
that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. END
BEGIN NOW A
gallant scene in truth it made. END
BEGIN NOW Crotthers was there at the foot of the
table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs
of the Mull of Galloway. END
BEGIN NOW There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose
countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature
wisdom. END
BEGIN NOW Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the
eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form
of Madden. END
BEGIN NOW The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the
hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer's kit
of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the
primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John
Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a
refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the
convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of
him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the
hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and
combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose
steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation
could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the
inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come. END
BEGIN NOW It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. END
BEGIN NOW Scep.) END
BEGIN NOW contentions would
appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to
accepted scientific methods. END
BEGIN NOW Science, it cannot be too often repeated,
deals with tangible phenomena. END
BEGIN NOW The man of science like the man in the
street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain
them as best he can. END
BEGIN NOW There may be, it is true, some questions which
science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by
Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. END
BEGIN NOW Canv.) END
BEGIN NOW regarding the future determination of sex. END
BEGIN NOW Must
we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the
postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of
males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the
differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine,
such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and
Valenti, a mixture of both? END
BEGIN NOW This would be tantamount to a cooperation
(one of nature's favourite devices) between the NISUS FORMATIVUS of the
nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position,
SUCCUBITUS FELIX of the passive element. END
BEGIN NOW The other problem raised by the
same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. END
BEGIN NOW It is interesting
because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but
we all die in different ways. END
BEGIN NOW Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. END
BEGIN NOW et Eug. END
BEGIN NOW Doc.) END
BEGIN NOW blames
the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract
adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. END
BEGIN NOW by inhaling the bacteria which lurk
in dust. END
BEGIN NOW These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered
by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all
denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic
cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors
and unfructified duennas--these, he said, were accountable for any and
every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. END
BEGIN NOW Kalipedia, he prophesied,
would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely
good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures,
plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and
Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little
attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass
the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. END
BEGIN NOW Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. END
BEGIN NOW Bacc.) END
BEGIN NOW attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case
of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to
marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect,
private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the
practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. END
BEGIN NOW Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too
true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the
peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. END
BEGIN NOW In fact when one comes to
look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off
so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human
shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. END
BEGIN NOW An ingenious
suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. END
BEGIN NOW Arith.) END
BEGIN NOW that both
natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution,
tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,
everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of
some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which
beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet
unascertained. END
BEGIN NOW Still the plain straightforward question why a child of
normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly
looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other
children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's
words, give us pause. END
BEGIN NOW Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and
cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths
are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous
germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively
shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to
disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement
which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the
maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial
to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. END
BEGIN NOW Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. END
BEGIN NOW Scep.) END
BEGIN NOW remark (or should it be called an
interruption?) END
BEGIN NOW that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute,
digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with
pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous
females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not
to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find
gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as
nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above
alluded to. END
BEGIN NOW For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately
acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this
morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening
bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from
an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that
staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed
victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly
dropped from its mother. END
BEGIN NOW In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom
(Pubb. END
BEGIN NOW Canv.) END
BEGIN NOW which took place in the commons' hall of the National
Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well
known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. END
BEGIN NOW in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. END
BEGIN NOW I.) END
BEGIN NOW is the able and
popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once
a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably,
to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--
the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as
he phrased it, to save her own. END
BEGIN NOW At the risk of her own, was the telling
rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate
and measured tone in which it was delivered. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
happy ACCOUCHEMENT. END
BEGIN NOW It had been a weary weary while both for patient and
doctor. END
BEGIN NOW All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had
manfully helped. END
BEGIN NOW She had. END
BEGIN NOW She had fought the good fight and now she was
very very happy. END
BEGIN NOW Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are
happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. END
BEGIN NOW Reverently
look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that
longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the
first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of
thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. END
BEGIN NOW And as her loving eyes
behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady
there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's
clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. END
BEGIN NOW He is older now (you and I may
whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of
years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of
the Ulster bank, College Green branch. END
BEGIN NOW O Doady, loved one of old,
faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the
roses! END
BEGIN NOW With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. END
BEGIN NOW God! END
BEGIN NOW How beautiful now across the mist of years! END
BEGIN NOW But their children are
grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary
Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria
Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called
after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford
and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever
there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. END
BEGIN NOW Young hopeful will be
christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr
Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle. END
BEGIN NOW And so time
wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. END
BEGIN NOW No, let no sigh break
from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. END
BEGIN NOW And Doady, knock the ashes from your
pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you
(may it be the distant day!) END
BEGIN NOW and dout the light whereby you read in the
Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to
bed, to rest. END
BEGIN NOW He knows and will call in His own good time. END
BEGIN NOW You too have
fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, to you my
hand. END
BEGIN NOW Well done, thou good and faithful servant! END
BEGIN NOW There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil
memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart
but they abide there and wait. END
BEGIN NOW He may suffer their memory to grow dim,
let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that
they were not or at least were otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW Yet a chance word will call
them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most
various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp
soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or
at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine. END
BEGIN NOW Not to insult
over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not
for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous
vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful. END
BEGIN NOW The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of
that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied
trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an
unhealthiness, a FLAIR, for the cruder things of life. END
BEGIN NOW A scene disengages
itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so
natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some
thought) with their immediate pleasures. END
BEGIN NOW A shaven space of lawn one soft
May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and
white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real
interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or
collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. END
BEGIN NOW And yonder
about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful
irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and
their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then,
Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear,
bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool
ardent fruit. END
BEGIN NOW A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but
there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are
gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of
girlish fond hands. END
BEGIN NOW He frowns a little just as this young man does now
with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs
glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the PIAZZETTA
giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of
reproach (ALLES VERGANGLICHE) in her glad look. END
BEGIN NOW Mark this farther and remember. END
BEGIN NOW The end comes suddenly. END
BEGIN NOW Enter that
antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their
faces. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. END
BEGIN NOW Quietude of
custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant
watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long
ago. END
BEGIN NOW But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with
preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,
compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field
and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an
instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the
thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the
transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the
word. END

BEGIN NOW -- III --


Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the
shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. END
BEGIN NOW His
(Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit
unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom
in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water
available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an
expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's
shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge
where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda
or a mineral. END
BEGIN NOW But how to get there was the rub. END
BEGIN NOW For the nonce he was
rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to
take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means
during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. END
BEGIN NOW So far as he could see he was
rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to
get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then
condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always
assuming that there was such a thing to be found. END
BEGIN NOW Accordingly after a few
such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take
up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in
the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more
properly, lane as far as the farrier's and the distinctly fetid
atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where
they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street
round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. END
BEGIN NOW But as he confidently anticipated
there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except
a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree,
outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a
quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional
whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding
his arms arched over his head, twice. END
BEGIN NOW This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it
which they accordingly did. END
BEGIN NOW So, bevelling around by Mullett's and the
Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped
by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to
vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering
thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the
mischance. END
BEGIN NOW So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as
it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the
recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where
the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. END
BEGIN NOW As it so
happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer happened to be
returning and the elder man recounted to his companion A PROPOS of the
incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. END
BEGIN NOW They
passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the
starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at
that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very
enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at
night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into
Store street, famous for its C division police station. END
BEGIN NOW Between this
point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen
thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's the stonecutter's in
his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the
other who was acting as his FIDUS ACHATES inhaled with internal
satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite
close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily
bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most
indispensable. END
BEGIN NOW Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where
is fancy bread, at Rourke's the baker's it is said. END
BEGIN NOW EN ROUTE to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet
perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete
possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober,
spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame
and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not
as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for
young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking
habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu
for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could
administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. END
BEGIN NOW Highly providential was
the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully
unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour
the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the
accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the
court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old
Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when
it got bruited about. END
BEGIN NOW The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of
those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous
in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or
two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole
through a ten gallon pot. END
BEGIN NOW Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet
parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law
were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect
the upper classes. END
BEGIN NOW Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers
with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time
which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any
chance they fall out over anything. END
BEGIN NOW You frittered away your time, he very
sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the
squandermania of the thing, fast women of the DEMIMONDE ran away with a
lot of l.s.d. END
BEGIN NOW into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you
got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he
relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and
bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy
which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point
where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round
to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. END
BEGIN NOW Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his
pubhunting CONFRERES but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part
of his brother medicos under all the circs. END
BEGIN NOW --And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing
whatsoever of any kind. END
BEGIN NOW Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back
of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier
of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted
their rather lagging footsteps. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen of his own accord stopped for no
special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the
light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure
of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. END
BEGIN NOW He began
to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having
happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that
he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's, Gumley. END
BEGIN NOW To
avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge. END
BEGIN NOW --Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted
again, calling:

--NIGHT! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the
compliment. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as
he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless
remained on the QUI VIVE with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish
in the least. END
BEGIN NOW Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not
by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on
to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by
placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city
proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might
be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever
boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment's notice, your money or
your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though
he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley's breath
redolent of rotten cornjuice. END
BEGIN NOW Lord John Corley some called him and his
genealogy came about in this wise. END
BEGIN NOW He was the eldest son of inspector
Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain
Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. END
BEGIN NOW His grandfather Patrick
Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there
whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. END
BEGIN NOW Rumour had it (though
not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de
Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its
kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman,
as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being
in service in the washkitchen. END
BEGIN NOW This therefore was the reason why the
still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen
was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley. END
BEGIN NOW Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. END
BEGIN NOW Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. END
BEGIN NOW His friends had
all deserted him. END
BEGIN NOW Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to
Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other
uncalledfor expressions. END
BEGIN NOW He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to
tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all, to
do. END
BEGIN NOW No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was
fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through
the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if
the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to finish. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow he was all in. END
BEGIN NOW --I wouldn't ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows
I'm on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW --There'll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys'
school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Garrett Deasy. END
BEGIN NOW Try it. END
BEGIN NOW You may
mention my name. END
BEGIN NOW --Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. END
BEGIN NOW I was
never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. END
BEGIN NOW I got stuck
twice in the junior at the christian brothers. END
BEGIN NOW --I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him. END
BEGIN NOW Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do
with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart
off the street. END
BEGIN NOW There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs
Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in
Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed
of friar Bacon) for a bob. END
BEGIN NOW He was starving too though he hadn't said a
word about it. END
BEGIN NOW Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still
Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that
Corley's brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving
of much credence. END
BEGIN NOW However HAUD IGNARUS MALORUM MISERIS SUCCURRERE DISCO
etcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he
got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which
was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the
wherewithal was demolished. END
BEGIN NOW But the cream of the joke was nothing would
get it out of Corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't a
thing to do but hand out the needful. END
BEGIN NOW Whereas. END
BEGIN NOW He put his hand in a
pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he
might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might
endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in
the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. END
BEGIN NOW A few broken
biscuits were all the result of his investigation. END
BEGIN NOW He tried his hardest
to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or
left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much
the reverse in fact. END
BEGIN NOW He was altogether too fagged out to institute a
thorough search though he tried to recollect. END
BEGIN NOW About biscuits he dimly
remembered. END
BEGIN NOW Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he
buy. END
BEGIN NOW However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the
dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out. END
BEGIN NOW --Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him. END
BEGIN NOW And so in point of fact they turned out to be. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen anyhow lent him
one of them. END
BEGIN NOW --Thanks, Corley answered, you're a gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW I'll pay you back one
time. END
BEGIN NOW Who's that with you? END
BEGIN NOW I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in
Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. END
BEGIN NOW You might put in a good word
for us to get me taken on there. END
BEGIN NOW I'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl
in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. END
BEGIN NOW God,
you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl Rosa. END
BEGIN NOW I don't
give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper. END
BEGIN NOW Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six
he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky
that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's,
bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara
and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow he was lagged
the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and
refusing to go with the constable. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman's sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was
having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
private account while Dublin slept. END
BEGIN NOW He threw an odd eye at the same time
now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor
as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was
not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. END
BEGIN NOW Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in
point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat
and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic
impecuniosity. END
BEGIN NOW Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of
that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour
all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter
of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal
servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis
altogether. END
BEGIN NOW In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance
intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. END
BEGIN NOW Pretty thick
that was certainly. END
BEGIN NOW The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his
practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite. END
BEGIN NOW Alluding to the encounter he said,
laughingly, Stephen, that is:

--He is down on his luck. END
BEGIN NOW He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman. END
BEGIN NOW At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,
moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
whereupon he observed evasively:

--Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. END
BEGIN NOW Now you mention it
his face was familiar to me. END
BEGIN NOW But, leaving that for the moment, how much
did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive? END
BEGIN NOW --Half a crown, Stephen responded. END
BEGIN NOW I daresay he needs it to sleep
somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW --Needs! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the
intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he
invariably does. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to
his deeds. END
BEGIN NOW But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a
smile, will you sleep yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Walking to Sandycove is out of the
question. END
BEGIN NOW And even supposing you did you won't get in after what occurred
at Westland Row station. END
BEGIN NOW Simply fag out there for nothing. END
BEGIN NOW I don't mean
to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you
leave your father's house? END
BEGIN NOW --To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer. END
BEGIN NOW --I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on
yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW Where does he live at present? END
BEGIN NOW I gathered in the course of
conversation that he had moved. END
BEGIN NOW --I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW --A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than
one and a born RACONTEUR if ever there was one. END
BEGIN NOW He takes great pride,
quite legitimate, out of you. END
BEGIN NOW You could go back perhaps, he hasarded,
still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when
it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that
English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third
companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to
them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did. END
BEGIN NOW There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it
was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by
the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell
cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings
they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and
Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in
accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on
the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or
something like that. END
BEGIN NOW --No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust in
that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr
Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. END
BEGIN NOW He
knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he
never realised what it is to be without regular meals. END
BEGIN NOW Of course you
didn't notice as much as I did. END
BEGIN NOW But it wouldn't occasion me the least
surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in
your drink for some ulterior object. END
BEGIN NOW He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile
allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly
coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair
to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony
medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition
to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning
by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or
Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed
which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a
loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he
put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple. END
BEGIN NOW --Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking
your brains, he ventured to throw o.ut. END
BEGIN NOW The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
friendliness which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of
features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by
two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw
through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself
allowed matters to more or less. END
BEGIN NOW Grinding poverty did have that effect
and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he
possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet. END
BEGIN NOW Adjacent to the men's public urinal they perceived an icecream car round
which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting
rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly
animated way, there being some little differences between the parties. END
BEGIN NOW --PUTTANA MADONNA, CHE CI DIA I QUATTRINI! END
BEGIN NOW HO RAGIONE? END
BEGIN NOW CULO ROTTO! END
BEGIN NOW --INTENDIAMOCI. END
BEGIN NOW MEZZO SOVRANO PIU ...

--DICE LUI, PERO! END
BEGIN NOW --MEZZO. END
BEGIN NOW --FARABUTTO! END
BEGIN NOW MORTACCI SUI! END
BEGIN NOW --MA ASCOLTA! END
BEGIN NOW CINQUE LA TESTA PIU ...

Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious
wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been
before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints
anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat
Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual
facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. END
BEGIN NOW A few
moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner
only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection
of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus HOMO
already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation
for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity. END
BEGIN NOW --Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to
break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape
of solid food, say, a roll of some description. END
BEGIN NOW Accordingly his first act was with characteristic SANGFROID to order
these commodities quietly. END
BEGIN NOW The HOI POLLOI of jarvies or stevedores or
whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes
apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual
portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for
some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the
floor. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having
just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be
sure, rather in a quandary over VOGLIO, remarked to his PROTEGE in an
audible tone of voice A PROPOS of the battle royal in the street which
was still raging fast and furious:

--A beautiful language. END
BEGIN NOW I mean for singing purposes. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you not write
your poetry in that language? END
BEGIN NOW BELLA POETRIA! END
BEGIN NOW It is so melodious and full. END
BEGIN NOW BELLADONNA. END
BEGIN NOW VOGLIO. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from
lassitude generally, replied:

--To fill the ear of a cow elephant. END
BEGIN NOW They were haggling over money. END
BEGIN NOW --Is that so? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were
absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds
it. END
BEGIN NOW The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this TETE-A-TETE put a boiling
swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a
rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. END
BEGIN NOW After which he
beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square
look at him later on so as not to appear to. END
BEGIN NOW For which reason he
encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by
surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be
called coffee gradually nearer him. END
BEGIN NOW --Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,
like names. END
BEGIN NOW Cicero, Podmore. END
BEGIN NOW Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, Mr Doyle. END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. END
BEGIN NOW What's in a name? END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. END
BEGIN NOW Of course. END
BEGIN NOW Our name
was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across. END
BEGIN NOW The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded
Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by
asking:

--And what might your name be? END
BEGIN NOW Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected
quarter, answered:

--Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather
bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and
water. END
BEGIN NOW --You know Simon Dedalus? END
BEGIN NOW he asked at length. END
BEGIN NOW --I've heard of him, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently
eavesdropping too. END
BEGIN NOW --He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
way and nodding. END
BEGIN NOW All Irish. END
BEGIN NOW --All too Irish, Stephen rejoined. END
BEGIN NOW As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business
and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor
of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the
remark:

--I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his
shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW The lefthand dead shot. END
BEGIN NOW Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures
being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain. END
BEGIN NOW --Bottles out there, say. END
BEGIN NOW Fifty yards measured. END
BEGIN NOW Eggs on the bottles. END
BEGIN NOW Cocks his gun over his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW Aims. END
BEGIN NOW He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. END
BEGIN NOW Then he
screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night
with an unprepossessing cast of countenance. END
BEGIN NOW --Pom! END
BEGIN NOW he then shouted once. END
BEGIN NOW The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there
being still a further egg. END
BEGIN NOW --Pom! END
BEGIN NOW he shouted twice. END
BEGIN NOW Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding
bloodthirstily:


  --BUFFALO BILL SHOOTS TO KILL,
    NEVER MISSED NOR HE NEVER WILL. END
BEGIN NOW A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like
asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley. END
BEGIN NOW --Beg pardon, the sailor said. END
BEGIN NOW --Long ago? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth. END
BEGIN NOW --Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic
influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. END
BEGIN NOW He
toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. END
BEGIN NOW I seen him do that in
Stockholm. END
BEGIN NOW --Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively. END
BEGIN NOW --Murphy's my name, the sailor continued. END
BEGIN NOW D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe. END
BEGIN NOW Know where that is? END
BEGIN NOW --Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied. END
BEGIN NOW --That's right, the sailor said. END
BEGIN NOW Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. END
BEGIN NOW That's
where I hails from. END
BEGIN NOW I belongs there. END
BEGIN NOW That's where I hails from. END
BEGIN NOW My little
woman's down there. END
BEGIN NOW She's waiting for me, I know. END
BEGIN NOW FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND
BEAUTY. END
BEGIN NOW She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years now,
sailing about. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to
the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy
night with a blind moon. END
BEGIN NOW Across the world for a wife. END
BEGIN NOW Quite a number of
stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden
and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary, a
favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey
and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. END
BEGIN NOW Never about the runaway
wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. END
BEGIN NOW The face at the
window! END
BEGIN NOW Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and
the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his
affections. END
BEGIN NOW You little expected me but I've come to stay and make a fresh
start. END
BEGIN NOW There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside. END
BEGIN NOW Believes
me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep. END
BEGIN NOW And there sits uncle Chubb or
Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in
shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. END
BEGIN NOW No chair for father. END
BEGIN NOW Broo! END
BEGIN NOW The
wind! END
BEGIN NOW Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, POST MORTEM child. END
BEGIN NOW With a high
ro! END
BEGIN NOW and a randy ro! END
BEGIN NOW and my galloping tearing tandy, O! END
BEGIN NOW Bow to the
inevitable. END
BEGIN NOW Grin and bear it. END
BEGIN NOW I remain with much love your brokenhearted
husband D B Murphy. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of
the jarvies with the request:

--You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you? END
BEGIN NOW The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of
plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was
passed from hand to hand. END
BEGIN NOW --Thank you, the sailor said. END
BEGIN NOW He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow
stammers, proceeded:

--We come up this morning eleven o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW The threemaster ROSEVEAN from
Bridgwater with bricks. END
BEGIN NOW I shipped to get over. END
BEGIN NOW Paid off this afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW There's my discharge. END
BEGIN NOW See? END
BEGIN NOW D. B. Murphy. END
BEGIN NOW A. END
BEGIN NOW B. S.

In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket
and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document. END
BEGIN NOW --You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,
leaning on the counter. END
BEGIN NOW --Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated
a bit since I first joined on. END
BEGIN NOW I was in the Red Sea. END
BEGIN NOW I was in China and
North America and South America. END
BEGIN NOW We was chased by pirates one voyage. END
BEGIN NOW I
seen icebergs plenty, growlers. END
BEGIN NOW I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the
Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled
a ship. END
BEGIN NOW I seen Russia. END
BEGIN NOW GOSPODI POMILYOU. END
BEGIN NOW That's how the Russians prays. END
BEGIN NOW --You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey. END
BEGIN NOW --Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. END
BEGIN NOW I seen queer
things too, ups and downs. END
BEGIN NOW I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor
same as I chew that quid. END
BEGIN NOW He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his
teeth, bit ferociously:

--Khaan! END
BEGIN NOW Like that. END
BEGIN NOW And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and
the livers of horses. END
BEGIN NOW Look here. END
BEGIN NOW Here they are. END
BEGIN NOW A friend of mine sent me. END
BEGIN NOW He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to
be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. END
BEGIN NOW The
printed matter on it stated: CHOZA DE INDIOS. END
BEGIN NOW BENI, BOLIVIA. END
BEGIN NOW All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage
women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,
sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of
them) outside some primitive shanties of osier. END
BEGIN NOW --Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. END
BEGIN NOW Stomachs like
breadgraters. END
BEGIN NOW Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more
children. END
BEGIN NOW See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver
raw. END
BEGIN NOW His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for
several minutes if not more. END
BEGIN NOW --Know how to keep them off? END
BEGIN NOW he inquired generally. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:

--Glass. END
BEGIN NOW That boggles 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Glass. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the
card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. END
BEGIN NOW It ran as
follows: TARJETA POSTAL, SENOR A BOUDIN, GALERIA BECCHE, SANTIAGO, CHILE. END
BEGIN NOW There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. END
BEGIN NOW Though not
an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping
transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don
Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in MARITANA on which occasion the
former's ball passed through the latter's hat) having detected a
discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented
himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the
compass on the strict q.t. END
BEGIN NOW somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the
missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's BONA FIDES
nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to
one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via
long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great
extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he
had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead
which was his longest. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a
pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up
with the net result that the scheme fell through. END
BEGIN NOW But even suppose it did
come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was not so
dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare
to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back. END
BEGIN NOW The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in
every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was
out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,
Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the
sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where
doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of
Park lane to renew acquaintance with. END
BEGIN NOW Another thing just struck him as a
by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see
about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music
embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing
and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so
on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots,
which might prove highly remunerative. END
BEGIN NOW Not, of course, with a hole and
corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M'Coy
type lend me your valise and I'll post you the ticket. END
BEGIN NOW No, something top
notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company
with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to
the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was
quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be
managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the
indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW But who? END
BEGIN NOW That was the rub. END
BEGIN NOW Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a
great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to
keep pace with the times APROPOS of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which,
it was mooted, was once more on the TAPIS in the circumlocution
departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of
effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. END
BEGIN NOW A great opportunity there
certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the
public at large, the average man, i.e. END
BEGIN NOW Brown, Robinson and Co. END
BEGIN NOW It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no
small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the
system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry
pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead
of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me
for a wife. END
BEGIN NOW After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum
months of it and merited a radical change of VENUE after the grind of
city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her
spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. END
BEGIN NOW There
were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island,
delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of
attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around
Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was
a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow,
rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly
wheelmen so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds of Donegal
where if report spoke true the COUP D'OEIL was exceedingly grand though
the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of
visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal
benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations
and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV, rhododendrons
several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts
and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men's fancy,
though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design
or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only
about three quarters of an hour's run from the pillar. END
BEGIN NOW Because of course
uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to
speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. END
BEGIN NOW Interesting to
fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was
whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two
sides in fact. END
BEGIN NOW He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and
passed it along to Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW --I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had
little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and
every pill was something different. END
BEGIN NOW One was a ship, another was a house,
another was a flower. END
BEGIN NOW Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the
chinks does. END
BEGIN NOW Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the
globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures. END
BEGIN NOW --And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. END
BEGIN NOW Knife in his
back. END
BEGIN NOW Knife like that. END
BEGIN NOW Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in
keeping with his character and held it in the striking position. END
BEGIN NOW --In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow
hid behind a door, come up behind him. END
BEGIN NOW Like that. END
BEGIN NOW PREPARE TO MEET YOUR
GOD, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Chuk! END
BEGIN NOW It went into his back up to the butt. END
BEGIN NOW His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further
questions even should they by any chance want to. END
BEGIN NOW --That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable
STILETTO. END
BEGIN NOW After which harrowing DENOUEMENT sufficient to appal the stoutest he
snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in
his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket. END
BEGIN NOW --They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in
the dark said for the benefit of them all. END
BEGIN NOW That was why they thought the
park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them
using knives. END
BEGIN NOW At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS
Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively
exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly ENTRE
NOUS variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, ALIAS the keeper, not
turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. END
BEGIN NOW His
inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in
itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn't
understand one jot of what was going on. END
BEGIN NOW Funny, very! END
BEGIN NOW There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. END
BEGIN NOW One man was reading in fits and
starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the
natives CHOZA DE, another the seaman's discharge. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, so far as he
was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. END
BEGIN NOW He vividly
recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as
yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land
troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively
speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was
just turned fifteen. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. END
BEGIN NOW Give us back them papers. END
BEGIN NOW The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape. END
BEGIN NOW --Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom inquired. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or
no. END
BEGIN NOW --Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he
had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but
he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust,
and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn. END
BEGIN NOW --What year would that be about? END
BEGIN NOW Mr B interrogated. END
BEGIN NOW Can you recall the
boats? END
BEGIN NOW Our SOI-DISANT sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:

--I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. END
BEGIN NOW Salt junk all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Tired seemingly, he ceased. END
BEGIN NOW His questioner perceiving that he was not
likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,
fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the
globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it
covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what
it meant to rule the waves. END
BEGIN NOW On more than one occasion, a dozen at the
lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated
old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly
redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him,
dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. END
BEGIN NOW And
it left him wondering why. END
BEGIN NOW Possibly he had tried to find out the secret
for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of
thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates. END
BEGIN NOW And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at
all. END
BEGIN NOW Nevertheless, without going into the MINUTIAE of the business, the
eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the
natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in
the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually
contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell
idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same
lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a
highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where
living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to
them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and
coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid
the elements whatever the season when duty called IRELAND EXPECTS THAT
EVERY MAN and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the
wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to
capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had
experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather. END
BEGIN NOW --There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself
a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman's
valet at six quid a month. END
BEGIN NOW Them are his trousers I've on me and he gave
me an oilskin and that jackknife. END
BEGIN NOW I'm game for that job, shaving and
brushup. END
BEGIN NOW I hate roaming about. END
BEGIN NOW There's my son now, Danny, run off to sea
and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where he could be
drawing easy money. END
BEGIN NOW --What age is he? END
BEGIN NOW queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side,
bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from
the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and
a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage. END
BEGIN NOW --Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny? END
BEGIN NOW He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it. END
BEGIN NOW The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt
with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be
seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an
anchor. END
BEGIN NOW --There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. END
BEGIN NOW I
must get a wash tomorrow or next day. END
BEGIN NOW It's them black lads I objects to. END
BEGIN NOW I hate those buggers. END
BEGIN NOW Suck your blood dry, they does. END
BEGIN NOW Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his
shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the
mariner's hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young
man's sideface looking frowningly rather. END
BEGIN NOW --Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. END
BEGIN NOW That was done when we were Iying
becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow, the
name of Antonio, done that. END
BEGIN NOW There he is himself, a Greek. END
BEGIN NOW --Did it hurt much doing it? END
BEGIN NOW one asked the sailor. END
BEGIN NOW That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. END
BEGIN NOW Someway
in his. END
BEGIN NOW Squeezing or. END
BEGIN NOW --See here, he said, showing Antonio. END
BEGIN NOW There he is cursing the mate. END
BEGIN NOW And
there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his
fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn. END
BEGIN NOW And in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did
actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the
unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time
stretched over. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. END
BEGIN NOW He's gone
too. END
BEGIN NOW Ate by sharks after. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, ay. END
BEGIN NOW He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression
of before. END
BEGIN NOW --Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said. END
BEGIN NOW --And what's the number for? END
BEGIN NOW loafer number two queried. END
BEGIN NOW --Eaten alive? END
BEGIN NOW a third asked the sailor. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with
some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of
the questioner about the number. END
BEGIN NOW Ate. END
BEGIN NOW A Greek he was. END
BEGIN NOW And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged
end:


    --AS BAD AS OLD ANTONIO,
    FOR HE LEFT ME ON MY OWNIO. END
BEGIN NOW The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat
peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her
own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom,
scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied
but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the
Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he
picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink. END
BEGIN NOW His
reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the
same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond
quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady
in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) END
BEGIN NOW and begged the chance of
his washing. END
BEGIN NOW Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your
washing. END
BEGIN NOW Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife's
undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a
man's similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper's marking ink
(hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me,
love my dirty shirt. END
BEGIN NOW Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired
the female's room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief
when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. END
BEGIN NOW Round the side
of the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face
round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing
that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the
group of gazers round skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was
no more of her. END
BEGIN NOW --The gunboat, the keeper said. END
BEGIN NOW --It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how
a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease
can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if
he values his health in the least. END
BEGIN NOW Unfortunate creature! END
BEGIN NOW Of course I
suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. END
BEGIN NOW Still no
matter what the cause is from ...

Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:

--In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a
roaring trade. END
BEGIN NOW Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy
the soul. END
BEGIN NOW She is a bad merchant. END
BEGIN NOW She buys dear and sells cheap. END
BEGIN NOW The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,
said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop
to INSTANTER to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any
oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere not
licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he
could truthfully state, he, as a PATERFAMILIAS, was a stalwart advocate
of from the very first start. END
BEGIN NOW Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort,
he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon
on everybody concerned. END
BEGIN NOW --You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe
in the soul. END
BEGIN NOW Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as
distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. END
BEGIN NOW I
believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as
the convolutions of the grey matter. END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise we would never have such
inventions as X rays, for instance. END
BEGIN NOW Do you? END
BEGIN NOW Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try
and concentrate and remember before he could say:

--They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and
therefore incorruptible. END
BEGIN NOW It would be immortal, I understand, but for the
possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can
hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other
practical jokes, CORRUPTIO PER SE and CORRUPTIO PER ACCIDENS both being
excluded by court etiquette. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he
felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:

--Simple? END
BEGIN NOW I shouldn't think that is the proper word. END
BEGIN NOW Of course, I grant
you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue
moon. END
BEGIN NOW But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance
to invent those rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I
believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same
applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon
such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour to say you
believe in the existence of a supernatural God. END
BEGIN NOW --O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several
of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial
evidence. END
BEGIN NOW On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they
were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in
their respective ages, clashed. END
BEGIN NOW --Has been? END
BEGIN NOW the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his
original point with a smile of unbelief. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not so sure about that. END
BEGIN NOW That's a matter for everyman's opinion and, without dragging in the
sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you IN TOTO there. END
BEGIN NOW My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine
forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the big
question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like
HAMLET and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better
than I, of course I needn't tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Can't you drink that coffee, by the
way? END
BEGIN NOW Let me stir it. END
BEGIN NOW And take a piece of that bun. END
BEGIN NOW It's like one of our
skipper's bricks disguised. END
BEGIN NOW Still no-one can give what he hasn't got. END
BEGIN NOW Try
a bit. END
BEGIN NOW --Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the
moment refusing to dictate further. END
BEGIN NOW Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir
or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something
approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and
lucrative) work. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or
nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in
run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings
and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower
orders. END
BEGIN NOW On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they
paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated
with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her
pianoplaying. END
BEGIN NOW The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do
good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. END
BEGIN NOW Sulphate
of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered
reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't remember when
it was or where. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables
seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the
vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis
involved. END
BEGIN NOW --Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being
stirred. END
BEGIN NOW Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug
from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and
took a sip of the offending beverage. END
BEGIN NOW --Still it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid
food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but
regular meals as the SINE QUA NON for any kind of proper work, mental or
manual. END
BEGIN NOW You ought to eat more solid food. END
BEGIN NOW You would feel a different man. END
BEGIN NOW --Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW But O, oblige me by taking away that
knife. END
BEGIN NOW I can't look at the point of it. END
BEGIN NOW It reminds me of Roman history. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,
a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or
antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least
conspicuous point about it. END
BEGIN NOW --Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom APROPOS of
knives remarked to his CONFIDANTE SOTTO VOCE. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think they are
genuine? END
BEGIN NOW He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and
lie like old boots. END
BEGIN NOW Look at him. END
BEGIN NOW Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full
of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was
quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire
fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability
in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel. END
BEGIN NOW He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. END
BEGIN NOW Though a
wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,
there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail
delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate
such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. END
BEGIN NOW He
might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told,
as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and
had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say
nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage
of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who
expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. END
BEGIN NOW On the
other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because
meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting
news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean
seas to draw the long bow about the schooner HESPERUS and etcetera. END
BEGIN NOW And
when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn't
probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows
coined about him. END
BEGIN NOW --Mind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed. END
BEGIN NOW Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. END
BEGIN NOW Giants, though
that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget
queen. END
BEGIN NOW In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as
they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn't straighten their legs
if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded,
indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever
you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from
sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. END
BEGIN NOW There's an
example again of simple souls. END
BEGIN NOW However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
reminded him a bit of Ludwig, ALIAS Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards
of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the
FLYING DUTCHMAN, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in
large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any
sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as
also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it,
he conceded. END
BEGIN NOW On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in
keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to
admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the
chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the
Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too
given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline
persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin
with garlic DE RIGUEUR off him or her next day on the quiet and, he
added, on the cheap. END
BEGIN NOW --Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like
that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own
hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they
carry in the abdomen. END
BEGIN NOW It comes from the great heat, climate generally. END
BEGIN NOW My
wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. END
BEGIN NOW Point of fact she could
actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in
(technically) Spain, i.e. END
BEGIN NOW Gibraltar. END
BEGIN NOW She has the Spanish type. END
BEGIN NOW Quite
dark, regular brunette, black. END
BEGIN NOW I for one certainly believe climate
accounts for character. END
BEGIN NOW That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry
in Italian. END
BEGIN NOW --The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very
passionate about ten shillings. END
BEGIN NOW ROBERTO RUBA ROBA SUA. END
BEGIN NOW --Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed. END
BEGIN NOW --Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown
listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles
triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso
Mastino. END
BEGIN NOW --It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. END
BEGIN NOW All are washed in the
blood of the sun. END
BEGIN NOW Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street
museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I
was just looking at those antique statues there. END
BEGIN NOW The splendid proportions
of hips, bosom. END
BEGIN NOW You simply don't knock against those kind of women here. END
BEGIN NOW An exception here and there. END
BEGIN NOW Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but
what I'm talking about is the female form. END
BEGIN NOW Besides they have so little
taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman's natural
beauty, no matter what you say. END
BEGIN NOW Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly
is, a foible of mine but still it's a thing I simply hate to see. END
BEGIN NOW Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the
others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, goo
collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. END
BEGIN NOW Shipahoy of course had
his own say to say. END
BEGIN NOW He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered
a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils
of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to
that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him. END
BEGIN NOW So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt's rock, wreck
of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the
moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell
remembered it PALME on Booterstown strand. END
BEGIN NOW That was the talk of the town
that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of
distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish TIMES), breakers running
over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with
horror. END
BEGIN NOW Then someone said something about the case of the S. S. LADY
CAIRNS of Swansea run into by the MONA which was on an opposite tack in
rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. END
BEGIN NOW No aid was
given. END
BEGIN NOW Her master, the MONA'S, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead
would give way. END
BEGIN NOW She had no water, it appears, in her hold. END
BEGIN NOW At this stage an incident happened. END
BEGIN NOW It having become necessary for him to
unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat. END
BEGIN NOW --Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just
gently dropping off into a peaceful doze. END
BEGIN NOW He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore
due left. END
BEGIN NOW While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who
noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum
sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his
burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and,
applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of
it with a gurgling noise. END
BEGIN NOW The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd
suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the
counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to
all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly
refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders
of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all
radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. END
BEGIN NOW Some person
or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the
cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief
space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently
giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his
bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it
apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. END
BEGIN NOW A hoof scooped anyway for new
foothold after sleep and harness jingled. END
BEGIN NOW Slightly disturbed in his
sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation
stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other
in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish
rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from
dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his
box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly
amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most
respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his
life who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year at one time which of course
the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. END
BEGIN NOW And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the
town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver. END
BEGIN NOW He drank needless to be
told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be
in a large way of business if--a big if, however--he had contrived to
cure himself of his particular partiality. END
BEGIN NOW All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same
thing. END
BEGIN NOW A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin,
the only launch that year. END
BEGIN NOW Right enough the harbours were there only no
ships ever called. END
BEGIN NOW There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently AU
FAIT. END
BEGIN NOW What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only
rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr
Worthington or some name like that, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Ask the then captain, he advised
them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day's
work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line. END
BEGIN NOW --Am I right, skipper? END
BEGIN NOW he queried of the sailor, now returning after his
private potation and the rest of his exertions. END
BEGIN NOW That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words
growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other
in seconds or thirds. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate
the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the
time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs
and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow in he
rolled after his successful libation-CUM-potation, introducing an
atmosphere of drink into the SOIREE, boisterously trolling, like a
veritable son of a seacook:


    --THE BISCUITS WAS AS HARD AS BRASS
      AND THE BEEF AS SALT AS LOT'S WIFE'S ARSE. END
BEGIN NOW O, JOHNNY LEVER! END
BEGIN NOW JOHNNY LEVER, O! END
BEGIN NOW After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene
and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form
provided. END
BEGIN NOW Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to
grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the
natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described
in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face
of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large
quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten
millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by
England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose
always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus
steam in the same vein. END
BEGIN NOW Their conversation accordingly became general and
all agreed that that was a fact. END
BEGIN NOW You could grow any mortal thing in Irish
soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan
growing tobacco. END
BEGIN NOW Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? END
BEGIN NOW But a day of reckoning, he stated CRESCENDO with no uncertain voice,
thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty
England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. END
BEGIN NOW There would
be a fall and the greatest fall in history. END
BEGIN NOW The Germans and the Japs were
going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. END
BEGIN NOW The Boers were the
beginning of the end. END
BEGIN NOW Brummagem England was toppling already and her
downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them
about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his
auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by
showing the tendon referred to on his boot. END
BEGIN NOW His advice to every Irishman
was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for
Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons. END
BEGIN NOW Silence all round marked the termination of his FINALE. END
BEGIN NOW The impervious
navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed. END
BEGIN NOW --Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit
peeved in response to the foregoing truism. END
BEGIN NOW To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred
but nevertheless held to his main view. END
BEGIN NOW --Who's the best troops in the army? END
BEGIN NOW the grizzled old veteran irately
interrogated. END
BEGIN NOW And the best jumpers and racers? END
BEGIN NOW And the best admirals and
generals we've got? END
BEGIN NOW Tell me that. END
BEGIN NOW --The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial
blemishes apart. END
BEGIN NOW --That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. END
BEGIN NOW The Irish catholic
peasant. END
BEGIN NOW He's the backbone of our empire. END
BEGIN NOW You know Jem Mullins? END
BEGIN NOW While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added
he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman
worthy of his salt that served it. END
BEGIN NOW Then they began to have a few
irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to
the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as
they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows. END
BEGIN NOW From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was
rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,
pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was
fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel,
unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather
concealed their strength than the opposite. END
BEGIN NOW It was quite on a par with
the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the
coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went
on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say
on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to
the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to
try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart. END
BEGIN NOW Another
little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in
common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for
England as against her, more so, in fact. END
BEGIN NOW And now, why? END
BEGIN NOW So the scene
between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or
have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously
bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence
trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student
of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. END
BEGIN NOW And
as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn't the other person at all,
he (B.) END
BEGIN NOW couldn't help feeling and most properly it was better to give
people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether
and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private
life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a
Dannyman coming forward and turning queen's evidence or king's now like
Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. END
BEGIN NOW Quite apart from
that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. END
BEGIN NOW Yet,
though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom
in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while
inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man
who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his
political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to
any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south,
have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words
passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky
mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his
adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial LIAISON by plunging
his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-
the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage
and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush
which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin
on. END
BEGIN NOW In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our
friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his
welcome. END
BEGIN NOW He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. END
BEGIN NOW Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up
smiling again. END
BEGIN NOW Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no
economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the
shadow. END
BEGIN NOW So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever
got rid of some l s d. in the course of his perambulations round the
docks in the congenial atmosphere of the OLD IRELAND tavern, come back to
Erin and so on. END
BEGIN NOW Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the
same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually
silenced the offender. END
BEGIN NOW --He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the
whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. END
BEGIN NOW He called me a jew and in
a heated fashion offensively. END
BEGIN NOW So I without deviating from plain facts in
the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his
family like me though in reality I'm not. END
BEGIN NOW That was one for him. END
BEGIN NOW A soft
answer turns away wrath. END
BEGIN NOW He hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone
saw. END
BEGIN NOW Am I not right? END
BEGIN NOW He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at
the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to
glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly. END
BEGIN NOW --EX QUIBUS, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four
eyes conversing, CHRISTUS or Bloom his name is or after all any other,
SECUNDUM CARNEM. END
BEGIN NOW --Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of
the question. END
BEGIN NOW It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right
and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though
every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government
it deserves. END
BEGIN NOW But with a little goodwill all round. END
BEGIN NOW It's all very fine to
boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality. END
BEGIN NOW I resent
violence and intolerance in any shape or form. END
BEGIN NOW It never reaches anything
or stops anything. END
BEGIN NOW A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. END
BEGIN NOW It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they
live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so
to speak. END
BEGIN NOW --Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen
assented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was
overwhelmingly right. END
BEGIN NOW And the whole world was full of that sort of thing. END
BEGIN NOW --You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. END
BEGIN NOW A hocuspocus of
conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely ...

All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad
blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously
supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely
a question of the money question which was at the back of everything
greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop. END
BEGIN NOW --They accuse, remarked he audibly. END
BEGIN NOW He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to, so as
the others in case they. END
BEGIN NOW --Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of
ruining. END
BEGIN NOW Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. END
BEGIN NOW History, would
you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the
inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an
uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for,
imported them. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. END
BEGIN NOW They
are practical and are proved to be so. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want to indulge in any
because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as
you are. END
BEGIN NOW But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest
spells poverty. END
BEGIN NOW Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead
America. END
BEGIN NOW Turks. END
BEGIN NOW It's in the dogma. END
BEGIN NOW Because if they didn't believe they'd
go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better, at least
so I think. END
BEGIN NOW That's the juggle on which the p.p's raise the wind on false
pretences. END
BEGIN NOW I'm, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as
that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see
everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes PRO RATA having a
comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in
the neighbourhood of 300 pounds per annum. END
BEGIN NOW That's the vital issue at
stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier
intercourse between man and man. END
BEGIN NOW At least that's my idea for what it's
worth. END
BEGIN NOW I call that patriotism. END
BEGIN NOW UBI PATRIA, as we learned a smattering of
in our classical days in ALMA MATER, VITA BENE. END
BEGIN NOW Where you can live well,
the sense is, if you work. END
BEGIN NOW Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this
synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. END
BEGIN NOW He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those
crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of
different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath
or seemed to. END
BEGIN NOW Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn't say
the words the voice he heard said, if you work. END
BEGIN NOW --Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work. END
BEGIN NOW The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who
owned them pro tem. END
BEGIN NOW observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must
work, have to, together. END
BEGIN NOW --I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest
possible sense. END
BEGIN NOW Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the
thing. END
BEGIN NOW Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. END
BEGIN NOW That's work too. END
BEGIN NOW Important work. END
BEGIN NOW After all, from the little I know of
you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to
recoup yourself and command your price. END
BEGIN NOW You have every bit as much right
to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. END
BEGIN NOW Each is
equally important. END
BEGIN NOW --You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may
be 1160 important because I belong to the FAUBOURG SAINT PATRICE called
Ireland for short. END
BEGIN NOW --I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated. END
BEGIN NOW --But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important
because it belongs to me. END
BEGIN NOW --What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under
some misapprehension. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me. END
BEGIN NOW Unfortunately, I didn't catch the latter
portion. END
BEGIN NOW What was it you ...? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:  1170

--We can't change the country. END
BEGIN NOW Let us change the subject. END
BEGIN NOW At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down
but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction to put
on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. END
BEGIN NOW The rebuke of some kind was
clearer than the other part. END
BEGIN NOW Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy
spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his
sober state. END
BEGIN NOW Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost
importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn't been
familiarised with the right sort of people. END
BEGIN NOW With a touch of fear for the
young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some

crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a
number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by
nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on

BEGIN NOW Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of
truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly
inadvisable, all things considered. END
BEGIN NOW Something evidently riled them in his
death. END
BEGIN NOW Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his
various different political arrangements were nearing completion or
whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change
his boots and clothes-after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to

died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or
quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of
their hands. END

before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were
decidedly of the ALICE, WHERE ART THOU order even prior to his starting

emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. END
BEGIN NOW Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which
undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate
five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So
who, though they weren't even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost
after their redeeming features were very few and far between. END

BEGIN NOW He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke
up the type in the INSUPPRESSIBLE or was it UNITED IRELAND, a privilege
he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat
when it was knocked off and he said THANK YOU, excited as he undoubtedly
was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure
mentioned between the cup and the lip: what's bred in the bone. END
BEGIN NOW Still as
regards return. END
BEGIN NOW You were a lucky dog if they didn't set the terrier at
you directly you got back. END
BEGIN NOW Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed,
Tom for and Dick and Harry against. END
BEGIN NOW And then, number one, you came up
against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like
the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, BELLA was
the boat's name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down
in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian
ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the
details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with
the description given, introduce himself with: EXCUSE ME, MY NAME IS SO
AND SO or some such commonplace remark. END
BEGIN NOW A more prudent course, as Bloom
said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage
under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land
first. END
BEGIN NOW --That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor
commented. END
BEGIN NOW She put the first nail in his coffin. END

Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. END
BEGIN NOW She loosened many a man's thighs. END
BEGIN NOW I
seen her picture in a barber's. END
BEGIN NOW The husband was a captain or an officer. END
BEGIN NOW --Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one. END
BEGIN NOW This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
amount of laughter among his ENTOURAGE. END
BEGIN NOW As regards Bloom he, without the
faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door
and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary
interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made
public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full
of sweet nothings. END
BEGIN NOW First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened
and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to
a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering
blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however,
who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was
public property all along though not to anything like the sensational
extent that it subsequently blossomed into. END
BEGIN NOW Since their names were
coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the
particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the
housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came
out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court
literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to
having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of
scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder
in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact
the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of
money out of. END
BEGIN NOW Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a
case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common
between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene,
strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and
forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's
smiles. END
BEGIN NOW The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say,
cropped up. END
BEGIN NOW Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in
the case, exist between married folk? END
BEGIN NOW Poser. END
BEGIN NOW Though it was no concern of
theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a
wave of folly. END
BEGIN NOW A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented
obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military
supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday FAREWELL, MY
GALLANT CAPTAIN kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the l8th
hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,
that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,
woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which
he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as
a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants
for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by
taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most
sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose,
thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the
fabled ass's kick. END
BEGIN NOW Looking back now in a retrospective kind of
arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. END
BEGIN NOW And then coming back was the
worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel
out of place as things always moved with the times. END
BEGIN NOW Why, as he reflected,
Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of
years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside
on the north side. END
BEGIN NOW North or south, however, it was just the wellknown
case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a
vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was
Spanish or half so, types that wouldn't do things by halves, passionate
abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds. END
BEGIN NOW --Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to
Stephen, about blood and the sun. END
BEGIN NOW And, if I don't greatly mistake she was
Spanish too. END
BEGIN NOW --The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or
other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and
the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and
so many. END
BEGIN NOW --Was she? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any
means, I never heard that rumour before. END
BEGIN NOW Possible, especially there, it
was as she lived there. END
BEGIN NOW So, Spain. END
BEGIN NOW Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket SWEETS OF, which reminded him by
the by of that Cap l street library book out of date, he took out his
pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly
finally he. END
BEGIN NOW --Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded
photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large
sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she
was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously
low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than
vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing
near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was IN OLD
MADRID, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. END
BEGIN NOW Her
(the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about
something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin's
premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic
execution. END
BEGIN NOW --Mrs Bloom, my wife the PRIMA DONNA Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom
indicated. END
BEGIN NOW Taken a few years since. END
BEGIN NOW In or about ninety six. END
BEGIN NOW Very like her
then. END
BEGIN NOW Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his 1440
legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major
Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a
singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered
barely sweet sixteen. END
BEGIN NOW As for the face it was a speaking likeness in
expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a
lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in
that getup. END
BEGIN NOW She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the
ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. END
BEGIN NOW He dwelt, being
a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general
developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon
he had seen those Grecian statues, 1450 perfectly developed as works of
art, in the National Museum. END
BEGIN NOW Marble could give the original, shoulders,
back, all the symmetry, all the rest. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, puritanisme, it does though
Saint Joseph's sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) END
BEGIN NOW Figne toi trop. END
BEGIN NOW Whereas
no photo could because it simply wasn't art in a word. END
BEGIN NOW The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's good
example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for
itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for
himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the
camera could not at all do justice to. END
BEGIN NOW But it was scarcely professional
etiquette so. END
BEGIN NOW Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet
wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm. END
BEGIN NOW And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind
of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. END
BEGIN NOW Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased
by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away
thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other's
possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving EMBONPOINT. END
BEGIN NOW In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen
slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose she was gone when he? END
BEGIN NOW I looked for the lamp which she told me
came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then
recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby
with met him pike hoses (SIC) in it which must have fell down
sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies
to Lindley Murray. END
BEGIN NOW The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, DISTINGUE
and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though
you wouldn't think he had it in him yet you would. END
BEGIN NOW Besides he said the
picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the
moment she was distinctly stouter. END
BEGIN NOW And why not? END
BEGIN NOW An awful lot of
makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur
with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial
tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage
favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole
business. END
BEGIN NOW How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between
the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in
court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising
expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or
three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when
the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. END
BEGIN NOW Then the
decree NISI and the King's proctor tries to show cause why and, he
failing to quash it, NISI was made absolute. END
BEGIN NOW But as for that the two
misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could
safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was
put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party
wronged in due course. END
BEGIN NOW He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to
Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the
historic FRACAS when the fallen leader's, who notoriously stuck to his
guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery,
(leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly
even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the
INSUPPRESSIBLE or no it was UNITED IRELAND (a by no means by the by
appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or
something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the
facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation
reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. END
BEGIN NOW Though palpably a
radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly
garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way
with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture
that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which
she, however, was the first to perceive. END
BEGIN NOW As those were particularly hot
times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a
nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated
lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a
grave character. END
BEGIN NOW His hat (Parnell's) a silk one was inadvertently knocked
off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it
up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to
him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting
and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time
all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a
matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than
anything else, what's bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at
his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at
once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect
APLOMB, saying: THANK YOU, SIR, though in a very different tone of voice
from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set
to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with
a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him
alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to
the grave. END
BEGIN NOW On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes
of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing 1530
immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case
for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate
husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from
the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial
moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms, drawing
attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic
rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master
upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his
visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter
and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with
her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there
were several others. END
BEGIN NOW He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed
and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men
in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a
lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on
fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her
duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little
flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with
improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another,
the cause of many LIAISONS between still attractive married women getting
on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases
of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt. END
BEGIN NOW It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of
brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time
with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him
his lifetime. END
BEGIN NOW In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take
unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim
ladies' society was a CONDITIO SINE QUA NON though he had the gravest
possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about
Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought
him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would
find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the
company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly
with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out
leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. END
BEGIN NOW To think of him
house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother,
was really too bad at his age. END
BEGIN NOW The queer suddenly things he popped out
with attracted the elder man who was several years the other's senior or
like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even
were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or,
failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled. END
BEGIN NOW --At what o'clock did you dine? END
BEGIN NOW he questioned of the slim form and tired
though unwrinkled face. END
BEGIN NOW --Some time yesterday, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW --Yesterday! END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow
Friday. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, you mean it's after twelve! END
BEGIN NOW --The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself. END
BEGIN NOW Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. END
BEGIN NOW Though
they didn't see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow
was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train
of thought. END
BEGIN NOW At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of
years previously when he had been a QUASI aspirant to parliamentary
honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect
(which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking
regard for those same ultra ideas. END
BEGIN NOW For instance when the evicted tenants
question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people's mind
though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his
faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't exactly hold
water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough
sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion
(a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently
partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than
Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a
backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo
put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of
the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he, though often considerably
misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated,
departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the
gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only
too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and
displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as
a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the
fittest, in a word. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was,
it was high time to be retiring for the night. END
BEGIN NOW The crux was it was a bit
risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody
having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on
the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame
paw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he
had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly
remembered, having been there, so to speak. END
BEGIN NOW On the other hand it was
altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove
suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two
alternatives. END
BEGIN NOW Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail
himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. END
BEGIN NOW His
initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive
but it grew on him someway. END
BEGIN NOW For one thing he mightn't what you call jump
at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn't
know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain
the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he
would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found
suitable. END
BEGIN NOW At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the
nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps's cocoa and a shakedown for the
night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at
least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he
failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the
proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. END
BEGIN NOW A move had to be made
because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to
be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any particular hurry to wend his
way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some
sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff
street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character's
whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings
(the mermaids') with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the
tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling
their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the
accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about
himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and
address, as Mr Algebra remarks PASSIM. END
BEGIN NOW At the same time he inwardly
chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about
his god being a jew. END
BEGIN NOW People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but
what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. END
BEGIN NOW The most vulnerable
point too of tender Achilles. END
BEGIN NOW Your god was a jew. END
BEGIN NOW Because mostly they
appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in
the county Sligo. END
BEGIN NOW --I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while
prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here you just come
home with me and talk things over. END
BEGIN NOW My diggings are quite close in the
vicinity. END
BEGIN NOW You can't drink that stuff. END
BEGIN NOW Do you like cocoa? END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW I'll just
pay this lot. END
BEGIN NOW The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain
sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper
of the shanty who didn't seem to. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that
Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less. END
BEGIN NOW All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B's) busy brain,
education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with
hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with
the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no
necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops
about it, and a slice of luck. END
BEGIN NOW An opening was all was wanted. END
BEGIN NOW Because he
more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his hopes on which
it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way
no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular
red herring just to. END
BEGIN NOW The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former
viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association dinner
in London somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this
thrilling announcement. END
BEGIN NOW Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared
to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell
had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect. END
BEGIN NOW To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. END
BEGIN NOW --Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner
put in, manifesting some natural impatience. END
BEGIN NOW --And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which
he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears. END
BEGIN NOW --Are you bad in the eyes? END
BEGIN NOW the sympathetic personage like the townclerk
queried. END
BEGIN NOW --Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a
bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen
portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. END
BEGIN NOW Sand in the Red Sea done that. END
BEGIN NOW One time I could read a book in the dark,
manner of speaking. END
BEGIN NOW THE ARABIAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENT was my favourite and
RED AS A ROSE IS SHE. END
BEGIN NOW Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a
hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time
(completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied
loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched
him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were
sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,
that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial
remark. END
BEGIN NOW To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to
rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and
foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the
occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host
as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not
looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand
total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four
coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously
spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in
unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well
worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark. END
BEGIN NOW --Come, he counselled to close the SEANCE. END
BEGIN NOW Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter
or shanty together and the ELITE society of oilskin and company whom
nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their DOLCE FAR NIENTE. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at
the, for a moment, the door. END
BEGIN NOW --One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the
moment. END
BEGIN NOW Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside
down, on the tables in cafes. END
BEGIN NOW To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom
replied without a moment's hesitation, saying straight off:

--To sweep the floor in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time
apologetic to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the bye,
his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. END
BEGIN NOW The night
air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on
his pins. END
BEGIN NOW --It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a
moment. END
BEGIN NOW The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW It's not far. END
BEGIN NOW Lean on me. END
BEGIN NOW Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on
accordingly. END
BEGIN NOW --Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind
of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all
that. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. END
BEGIN NOW where the
municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes
wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh
fields and pastures new. END
BEGIN NOW And APROPOS of coffin of stones the analogy was
not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of
seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of
the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame
evicted tenants he had put in their holdings. END
BEGIN NOW So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom,
as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm
in arm across Beresford place. END
BEGIN NOW Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand
in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first
go-off but the music of Mercadante's HUGUENOTS, Meyerbeer's SEVEN LAST
WORDS ON THE CROSS and Mozart's TWELFTH MASS he simply revelled in, the
GLORIA in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such,
literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. END
BEGIN NOW He infinitely
preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the
opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey
hymns or BID ME TO LIVE AND I WILL LIVE THY PROTESTANT TO BE. END
BEGIN NOW He also
yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini's STABAT MATER, a work
simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion
Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly
adding to her other laureis and putting the others totally in the shade,
in the jesuit fathers' church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred
edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or
VIRTUOSI rather. END
BEGIN NOW There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to
come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a
sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. END
BEGIN NOW On
the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the DON GIOVANNI
description and MARTHA, a gem in its line, he had a PENCHANT, though with
only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as
Mendelssohn. END
BEGIN NOW And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about
the old favourites, he mentioned PAR EXCELLENCE Lionel's air in MARTHA,
M'APPARI, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more
accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips
of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number,
in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, in reply to
a politely put query, said he didn't sing it but launched out into
praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that period, the
lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who
ANNO LUDENDO HAUSI, DOULANDUS, an instrument he was contemplating
purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though
the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby
and son with their DUX and COMES conceits and Byrd (William) who played
the virginals, he said, in the Queen's chapel or anywhere else he found
them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull. END
BEGIN NOW On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond
the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,
brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not
perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive
guineas and John Bull. END
BEGIN NOW He inquired if it was John Bull the political
celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a
striking coincidence. END
BEGIN NOW By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,
who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other's sleeve
gently, jocosely remarking:

--Our lives are in peril tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Beware of the steamroller. END
BEGIN NOW They thereupon stopped. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite
near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh
because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a
taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the
lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW But such a
good poor brute he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he wisely
reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might
crop up. END
BEGIN NOW He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse,
without a second care in the world. END
BEGIN NOW But even a dog, he reflected, take
that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy
horror to face. END
BEGIN NOW But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was
built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into
potheen in his hump. END
BEGIN NOW Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained,
nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. END
BEGIN NOW Whale with a harpoon
hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke,
chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. END
BEGIN NOW These timely
reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat
distracted from Stephen's words while the ship of the street was
manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old. END
BEGIN NOW --What's this I was saying? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, yes! END
BEGIN NOW My wife, he intimated, plunging IN
MEDIAS RES, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your
acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind. END
BEGIN NOW He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,
image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome
blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as
he was perhaps not that way built. END
BEGIN NOW Still, supposing he had his father's gift as he more than suspected, it
opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall's Irish industries,
concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general. END
BEGIN NOW Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air YOUTH HERE HAS END
by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come
from. END
BEGIN NOW Even more he liked an old German song of JOHANNES JEEP about the
clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled
Bloom a bit:


    VON DER SIRENEN LISTIGKEIT
    TUN DIE POETEN DICHTEN. END
BEGIN NOW These opening bars he sang and translated EXTEMPORE. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, nodding, said
he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he
did. END
BEGIN NOW A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,
which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,
if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such
as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its
own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate
possessor in the near future an ENTREE into fashionable houses in the
best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of
business and titled people where with his university degree of B. END
BEGIN NOW A. END
BEGIN NOW (a
huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the
good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being
blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and
other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the
better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in--
society's sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like
that could militate against you. END
BEGIN NOW It was in fact only a matter of months
and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and
artistic CONVERSAZIONES during the festivities of the Christmas season,
for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and
being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he
happened to know, were on record--in fact, without giving the show away,
he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. END
BEGIN NOW Added to
which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be
sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. END
BEGIN NOW Not, he
parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily
embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of
time. END
BEGIN NOW But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and
both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in
the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a
cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, though
taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,
different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as
it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical world after the usual
hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan
St Austell and Hilton St Just and their GENUS OMNE. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, beyond a shadow
of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital
opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city's
esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a
grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup,
if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big IF,
however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable
procrastination which often tripped -up a too much feted prince of good
fellows. END
BEGIN NOW And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his
own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his
spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his
vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a
matter for himself alone. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that
was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose
for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all. END
BEGIN NOW The horse was just then. END
BEGIN NOW And later on at a propitious opportunity he
purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on
the FOOLS STEP IN WHERE ANGELS principle, advising him to sever his
connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone
to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when
not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in
Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person's
character, no pun intended. END
BEGIN NOW The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,
rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on
the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking
globes of turds. END
BEGIN NOW Slowly three times, one after another, from a full
crupper he mired. END
BEGIN NOW And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had
ended, patient in his scythed car. END
BEGIN NOW Side by side Bloom, profiting by the CONTRETEMPS, with Stephen passed
through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over
a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen
singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad. END
BEGIN NOW UND ALLE SCHIFFE BRUCKEN. END
BEGIN NOW The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely
watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one
full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, TO BE MARRIED BY FATHER
MAHER. END
BEGIN NOW As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing
their TETE-A-TETE (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens
enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the
same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in
the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in
any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in
his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street AND LOOKED AFTER THEIR
LOWBACKED CAR. END
BEGIN NOW * * * * * * *


What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning? END
BEGIN NOW Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they
followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and
Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,
Gardiner's place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of
Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing
right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. END
BEGIN NOW Approaching,
disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before
George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than
the arc which it subtends. END
BEGIN NOW Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary? END
BEGIN NOW Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and
glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed
corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,
ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the
study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the
presabbath, Stephen's collapse. END
BEGIN NOW Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective
like and unlike reactions to experience? END
BEGIN NOW Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
plastic or pictorial. END
BEGIN NOW Both preferred a continental to an insular manner
of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. END
BEGIN NOW Both
indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. END
BEGIN NOW Both admitted the
alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
magnetism. END
BEGIN NOW Were their views on some points divergent? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's views on the importance of dietary
and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on
the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom
assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved
in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to
christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,
son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of
Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (died
266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and
interred at Rossnaree. END
BEGIN NOW The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric
inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first
no bigger than a woman's hand. END
BEGIN NOW Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative? END
BEGIN NOW The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining
paraheliotropic trees. END
BEGIN NOW Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in
the past? END
BEGIN NOW In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's
corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. END
BEGIN NOW In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall
between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of
Uppercross. END
BEGIN NOW In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and
prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class
railway carriages of suburban lines. END
BEGIN NOW In 1888 frequently with major Brian
Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on
the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. END
BEGIN NOW Once in 1892 and once
in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour
of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west. END
BEGIN NOW What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,
1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their
destination? END
BEGIN NOW He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction
of the converse domain of interindividual relations. END
BEGIN NOW As in what ways? END
BEGIN NOW From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence
to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived. END
BEGIN NOW What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination? END
BEGIN NOW At the housesteps of the 4th Of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number
7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket
of his trousers to obtain his latchkey. END
BEGIN NOW Was it there? END
BEGIN NOW It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on
the day but one preceding. END
BEGIN NOW Why was he doubly irritated? END
BEGIN NOW Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
himself twice not to forget. END
BEGIN NOW What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively)
and inadvertently, keyless couple? END
BEGIN NOW To enter or not to enter. END
BEGIN NOW To knock or not to knock. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom's decision? END
BEGIN NOW A stratagem. END
BEGIN NOW Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area
railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower
union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of
five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the
area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating
himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of
the fall. END
BEGIN NOW Did he fall? END
BEGIN NOW By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois
measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical
selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist
of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to
wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine
hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six
hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and
twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C
B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV. END
BEGIN NOW Did he rise uninjured by concussion? END
BEGIN NOW Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at
its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its
fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent
scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal
gas by turningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he
reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle. END
BEGIN NOW What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive? END
BEGIN NOW Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a
candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man
leaving the kitchen holding a candle. END
BEGIN NOW Did the man reappear elsewhere? END
BEGIN NOW After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the
halldoor. END
BEGIN NOW The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. END
BEGIN NOW In the open space
of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle. END
BEGIN NOW Did Stephen obey his sign? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted
candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a
turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's
house. END
BEGIN NOW What did Bloom do? END
BEGIN NOW He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its
flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen
with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary,
knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped
sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram
coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and
M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of
paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential
energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements
to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air. END
BEGIN NOW Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think? END
BEGIN NOW Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,
had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the
college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county
of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his
first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his
godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia
Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard)
Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street: of
his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve
North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier
1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of
university College, 16 Stephen's Green, north: of his sister Dilly
(Delia) in his father's house in Cabra. END
BEGIN NOW What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the
fire towards the opposite wall? END
BEGIN NOW Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,
stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the
chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded
unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies'
grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position
clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the
third at their point of junction. END
BEGIN NOW What did Bloom see on the range? END
BEGIN NOW On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left
(larger) hob a black iron kettle. END
BEGIN NOW What did Bloom do at the range? END
BEGIN NOW He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle
to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it
flow. END
BEGIN NOW Did it flow? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of
2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of
filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant
cost of 5 pounds per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of
the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a
distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving
tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge,
upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply
of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the
overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks
engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of the waterworks
committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other
than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being
had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893)
particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration
of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had
been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of
their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr
Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another
section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound. END
BEGIN NOW What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
returning to the range, admire? END
BEGIN NOW Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in
seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific
exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface
particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence
of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic
quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides:
its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar
icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance:
its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its
indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region
below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability
of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and
hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the
most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its
persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and
downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and
volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns:
its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones:
its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and
confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic
currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its
vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and
latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and
exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate,
saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its
composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part
of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead
Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate
dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst
and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and
paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow,
hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and
bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and
archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and
arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility
in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power
stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals,
rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality
derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to
level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe),
numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity
as constituting 90 percent of the human body: the noxiousness of its
effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater,
stagnant pools in the waning moon. END
BEGIN NOW Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he
return to the stillflowing tap? END
BEGIN NOW To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's
lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours
previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold
neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long
redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller. END
BEGIN NOW What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer? END
BEGIN NOW That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month
of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of
glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language. END
BEGIN NOW What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a
preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid
splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case
of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to
cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot? END
BEGIN NOW The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius. END
BEGIN NOW What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress? END
BEGIN NOW Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric
energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the
lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed. END
BEGIN NOW Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest? END
BEGIN NOW Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
recuperation. END
BEGIN NOW What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
agency of fire? END
BEGIN NOW The phenomenon of ebullition. END
BEGIN NOW Fanned by a constant updraught of
ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was
communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses
of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated
fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their
vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant),
transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. END
BEGIN NOW Heat
(convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was
constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to
the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven
unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part
absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the
water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as
the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound
of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees Fahrenheit. END
BEGIN NOW What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature? END
BEGIN NOW A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
both sides simultaneously. END
BEGIN NOW For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled? END
BEGIN NOW To shave himself. END
BEGIN NOW What advantages attended shaving by night? END
BEGIN NOW A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly
encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:
quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when
awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and
perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper
read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a
shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might
cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with
precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done. END
BEGIN NOW Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise? END
BEGIN NOW Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine
feminine passive active hand. END
BEGIN NOW What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting
influence? END
BEGIN NOW The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human
blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural
order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery. END
BEGIN NOW What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the
kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal
breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a
moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white
goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper,
and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. END
BEGIN NOW On the middle shelf a chipped
eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black
olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree's potted meat, an
oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a
halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's white invalid port, half
disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps's
soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb in a
crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best
crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire,
the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more
redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery
containing a naggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted
by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added
to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts,
made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two
cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh
ribsteak. END
BEGIN NOW On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various
sizes and proveniences. END
BEGIN NOW What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser? END
BEGIN NOW Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,
numbered 8 87, 88 6. END
BEGIN NOW What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow? END
BEGIN NOW Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative
of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive
result of which he had read in the EVENING TELEGRAPH, late pink edition,
in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been
received by him? END
BEGIN NOW In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street:
in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street
lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a
throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the
church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and
Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons
had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy
of the current issue of the FREEMAN'S JOURNAL AND NATIONAL PRESS which he
had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded
towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster
street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and
bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of
prediction. END
BEGIN NOW What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations? END
BEGIN NOW The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by
failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding
originally from a successful interpretation. END
BEGIN NOW His mood? END
BEGIN NOW He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he
was satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW What satisfied him? END
BEGIN NOW To have sustained no positive loss. END
BEGIN NOW To have brought a positive gain to
others. END
BEGIN NOW Light to the gentiles. END
BEGIN NOW How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile? END
BEGIN NOW He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's
soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed
on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the
prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity
prescribed. END
BEGIN NOW What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
guest? END
BEGIN NOW Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he
substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served
extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the
viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion
(Molly). END
BEGIN NOW Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
hospitality? END
BEGIN NOW His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted
them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct,
the creature cocoa. END
BEGIN NOW Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to
complete the act begun? END
BEGIN NOW The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right
side of his guest's jacket. END
BEGIN NOW A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's
handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition. END
BEGIN NOW Who drank more quickly? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking,
from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady
flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two,
nine to three. END
BEGIN NOW What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act? END
BEGIN NOW Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from
literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had
applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the
solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life. END
BEGIN NOW Had he found their solution? END
BEGIN NOW In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,
the answers not bearing in all points. END
BEGIN NOW What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,
potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering
of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for competition by the
SHAMROCK, a weekly newspaper? END
BEGIN NOW AN AMBITION TO SQUINT
    AT MY VERSES IN PRINT
    MAKES ME HOPE THAT FOR THESE YOU'LL FIND ROOM. END
BEGIN NOW IF YOU SO CONDESCEND
    THEN PLEASE PLACE AT THE END
    THE NAME OF YOURS TRULY, L. BLOOM. END
BEGIN NOW Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him? END
BEGIN NOW Name, age, race, creed. END
BEGIN NOW What anagrams had he made on his name in youth? END
BEGIN NOW Leopold Bloom
    Ellpodbomool
    Molldopeloob
    Bollopedoom
    Old Ollebo, M. P.


What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic
poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888? END
BEGIN NOW POETS OFT HAVE SUNG IN RHYME
    OF MUSIC SWEET THEIR PRAISE DIVINE. END
BEGIN NOW LET THEM HYMN IT NINE TIMES NINE. END
BEGIN NOW DEARER FAR THAN SONG OR WINE. END
BEGIN NOW YOU ARE MINE. END
BEGIN NOW THE WORLD IS MINE. END
BEGIN NOW What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,
entitled IF BRIAN BORU COULD BUT COME BACK AND SEE OLD DUBLIN NOW,
commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,
49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the
valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand
annual Christmas pantomime SINBAD THE SAILOR (produced by R Shelton 26
December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A.
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the
personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir,
harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl? END
BEGIN NOW Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,
the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded
1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and
duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary):
thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional
emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on
Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction
resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-
political, non-topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused
by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white articles of non-intellectual,
non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was
in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of
appropriate music and humorous allusions from EVERYBODY'S BOOK OF JOKES
(1000 pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous
and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel
Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral,
Dunbar Plunket Barton. END
BEGIN NOW What relation existed between their ages? END
BEGIN NOW 16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen
was 6. END
BEGIN NOW 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present
age Bloom would be 54. END
BEGIN NOW In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as
arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883
had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904
when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be
38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen
would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190
years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221
years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while,
if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the
year 3072 A.D., Bloomwould have been obliged to have been alive 83,300
years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C. END
BEGIN NOW What events might nullify these calculations? END
BEGIN NOW The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new
era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent
extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable. END
BEGIN NOW How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance? END
BEGIN NOW Two. END
BEGIN NOW The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina
Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's
mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand
in salutation. END
BEGIN NOW The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy
Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and
Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older. END
BEGIN NOW Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and
afterwards seconded by the father? END
BEGIN NOW Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined. END
BEGIN NOW Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a
third connecting link between them? END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the
house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and
had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms
Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts
of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom
who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the
employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of
sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road. END
BEGIN NOW Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her? END
BEGIN NOW He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with
slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular
road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for
a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses
unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with
inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired
landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the
Phoenix Park and vice versa. END
BEGIN NOW Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity? END
BEGIN NOW Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of
bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual
changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,
velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round
and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe. END
BEGIN NOW What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years
deceased? END
BEGIN NOW The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal
deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the
Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart
Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers. END
BEGIN NOW Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation
which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the
more desirable? END
BEGIN NOW The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND HOW TO
OBTAIN IT which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front
of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and
produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and
the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility. END
BEGIN NOW Had any special agility been his in earlier youth? END
BEGIN NOW Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full
circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had
excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever
movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed
abdominal muscles. END
BEGIN NOW Did either openly allude to their racial difference? END
BEGIN NOW Neither. END
BEGIN NOW What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts
about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen's thoughts about
Bloom's thoughts about Stephen? END
BEGIN NOW He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew
that he knew that he was not. END
BEGIN NOW What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective
parentages? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently
Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin
and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and
Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, eldest surviving male
consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary,
daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier). END
BEGIN NOW Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or
layman? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone, in
the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James
O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump
in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in
the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen (once) by the reverend
Charles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. END
BEGIN NOW Did they find their educational careers similar? END
BEGIN NOW Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively
through a dame's school and the high school. END
BEGIN NOW Substituting Bloom for
Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,
junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the
matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the
royal university. END
BEGIN NOW Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university
of life? END
BEGIN NOW Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had
or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him. END
BEGIN NOW What two temperaments did they individually represent? END
BEGIN NOW The scientific. END
BEGIN NOW The artistic. END
BEGIN NOW What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards
applied, rather than towards pure, science? END
BEGIN NOW Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a
state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his
appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once
revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting
telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water
siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump. END
BEGIN NOW Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of
kindergarten? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
catapults. END
BEGIN NOW They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the
twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature
mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to
correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically
costumed dolls. END
BEGIN NOW What also stimulated him in his cogitations? END
BEGIN NOW The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the
former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George's street, south, the latter at his
6-1/2d shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry
street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities
hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in
triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined),
horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising
efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to

BEGIN NOW His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by
a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated
engaged in writing. END

What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf
Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in
consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the
form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to I
of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of
27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street,
Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at
3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra
smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at
the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general
drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis. END

intuition? END
BEGIN NOW Coincidence. END
BEGIN NOW Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see? END
BEGIN NOW He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words
by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament
relieved. END
BEGIN NOW Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him,
described by the narrator as A PISGAH SIGHT OF PALESTINE OR THE PARABLE
OF THE PLUMS? END
BEGIN NOW It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by
implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms
(e.g. END
BEGIN NOW MY FAVOURITE HERO OR PROCRASTINATION IS THE THIEF OF TIME) composed
during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction
with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social,
personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as
model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of
preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form,
following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon's
STUDIES IN BLUE, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency
or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic
auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently
augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer
nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three
following, videlicet, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise
3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m. END
BEGIN NOW Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently
engaged his mind? END
BEGIN NOW What to do with our wives. END
BEGIN NOW What had been his hypothetical singular solutions? END
BEGIN NOW Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,
nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,
chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided
clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute,
guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly
visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly
commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy
shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic
irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically
controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and
with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female
acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of
evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction
agreeable. END
BEGIN NOW What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution? END
BEGIN NOW In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and
Hebrew characters. END
BEGIN NOW She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals
as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a
city in Canada, Quebec. END
BEGIN NOW She understood little of political complications,
internal, or balance of power, external. END
BEGIN NOW In calculating the addenda of
bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. END
BEGIN NOW After completion of
laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of
calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of
copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. END
BEGIN NOW Unusual polysyllables of foreign
origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both:
metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), ALIAS (a mendacious person mentioned
in sacred scripture). END
BEGIN NOW What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things? END
BEGIN NOW The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances,
proved true by construction. END
BEGIN NOW The counterbalance of her proficiency of
judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment. END
BEGIN NOW How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance? END
BEGIN NOW Variously. END
BEGIN NOW By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a
certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent
knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's
ignorant lapse. END
BEGIN NOW With what success had he attempted direct instruction? END
BEGIN NOW She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest
comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty
remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated
with error. END
BEGIN NOW What system had proved more effective? END
BEGIN NOW Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest. END
BEGIN NOW Example? END
BEGIN NOW She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she
disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new
hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat. END
BEGIN NOW Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of
postexilic eminence did he adduce? END
BEGIN NOW Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author
of MORE NEBUKIM (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such
eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose
none like Moses (Maimonides). END
BEGIN NOW What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth
seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by
Stephen? END
BEGIN NOW That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,
name uncertain. END
BEGIN NOW Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a
selected or rejected race mentioned? END
BEGIN NOW Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),
Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist). END
BEGIN NOW What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish
languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts
by guest to host and by host to guest? END
BEGIN NOW By Stephen: SUIL, SUIL, SUIL ARUN, SUIL GO SIOCAIR AGUS SUIL GO CUIN
(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care). END
BEGIN NOW By Bloom: KIFELOCH, HARIMON RAKATEJCH M'BAAD L'ZAMATEJCH (thy temple amid
thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate). END
BEGIN NOW How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made
in substantiation of the oral comparison? END
BEGIN NOW By juxtaposition. END
BEGIN NOW On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior
literary style, entituled SWEETS OF SIN (produced by Bloom and so
manipulated that its front cover carne in contact with the surface of the
table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish
characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn
wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of
mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal
and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100. END
BEGIN NOW Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the
extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical? END
BEGIN NOW Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and
syntax and practically excluding vocabulary. END
BEGIN NOW What points of contact existed between these languages and between the
peoples who spoke them? END
BEGIN NOW The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and
servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been
taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary
instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel,
and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their
archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic,
toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works
of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor,
Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth,
Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the
isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.
Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription of
their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the
restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish
political autonomy or devolution. END
BEGIN NOW What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,
ethnically irreducible consummation? END
BEGIN NOW KOLOD BALEJWAW PNIMAH
    NEFESCH, JEHUDI, HOMIJAH. END
BEGIN NOW Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich? END
BEGIN NOW In consequence of defective mnemotechnic. END
BEGIN NOW How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? END
BEGIN NOW By a periphrastic version of the general text. END
BEGIN NOW In what common study did their mutual reflections merge? END
BEGIN NOW The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of
modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions
(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic). END
BEGIN NOW Did the
guest comply with his host's request? END
BEGIN NOW Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters. END
BEGIN NOW What was Stephen's auditive sensation? END
BEGIN NOW He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of
the past. END
BEGIN NOW What was Bloom's visual sensation? END
BEGIN NOW He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future. END
BEGIN NOW What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional
quasisensations of concealed identities? END
BEGIN NOW Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by
Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as
leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair. END
BEGIN NOW Auditively, Bloom's: The
traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe. END
BEGIN NOW What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what
exemplars? END
BEGIN NOW In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very
reverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost of
Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. END
BEGIN NOW At the bar, English or Irish:
exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage modern
or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian Osmond Tearle
(died 1901), exponent of Shakespeare. END
BEGIN NOW Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange
legend on an allied theme? END
BEGIN NOW Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being
secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid
residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream
plus cocoa, having been consumed. END
BEGIN NOW Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend. END
BEGIN NOW LITTLE HARRY HUGHES AND HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS ALL
    WENT OUT FOR TO PLAY BALL. END
BEGIN NOW AND THE VERY FIRST BALL LITTLE HARRY HUGHES PLAYED
    HE DROVE IT O'ER THE JEW'S GARDEN WALL. END
BEGIN NOW AND THE VERY SECOND BALL LITTLE HARRY HUGHES PLAYED
    HE BROKE THE JEW'S WINDOWS ALL. END
BEGIN NOW How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part? END
BEGIN NOW With unmixed feeling. END
BEGIN NOW Smiling, a jew he heard with pleasure and saw the
unbroken kitchen window. END
BEGIN NOW Recite the second part (minor) of the legend. END
BEGIN NOW THEN OUT THERE CAME THE JEW'S DAUGHTER
    AND SHE ALL DRESSED IN GREEN. END
BEGIN NOW "COME BACK, COME BACK, YOU PRETTY LITTLE BOY,
    AND PLAY YOUR BALL AGAIN." END
BEGIN NOW "I CAN'T COME BACK AND I WON'T COME BACK
    WITHOUT MY SCHOOLFELLOWS ALL. END
BEGIN NOW FOR IF MY MASTER HE DID HEAR
    HE'D MAKE IT A SORRY BALL." END
BEGIN NOW SHE TOOK HIM BY THE LILYWHITE HAND
    AND LED HIM ALONG THE HALL
    UNTIL SHE LED HIM TO A ROOM
    WHERE NONE COULD HEAR HIM CALL. END
BEGIN NOW SHE TOOK A PENKNIFE OUT OF HER POCKET
    AND CUT OFF  HIS LITTLE HEAD. END
BEGIN NOW AND NOW HE'LL PLAY HIS BALL NO MORE
    FOR HE LIES AMONG THE DEAD. END
BEGIN NOW How did the father of Millicent receive this second part? END
BEGIN NOW With mixed feelings. END
BEGIN NOW Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's
daughter, all dressed in green. END
BEGIN NOW Condense Stephen's commentary. END
BEGIN NOW One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. END
BEGIN NOW Once by
inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. END
BEGIN NOW It comes when he
is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope
and youth, holds him unresisting. END
BEGIN NOW It leads him to a strange habitation,
to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him,
consenting. END
BEGIN NOW Why was the host (victim predestined) sad? END
BEGIN NOW He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him
should by him not be told. END
BEGIN NOW Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still? END
BEGIN NOW In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy. END
BEGIN NOW Why was the host (secret infidel) silent? END
BEGIN NOW He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of
opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,
hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism. END
BEGIN NOW From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
totally immune? END
BEGIN NOW From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite
time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. END
BEGIN NOW From somnambulism: once,
sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a
heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled,
unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping. END
BEGIN NOW Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
of his family? END
BEGIN NOW Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation
of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night
attire with a vacant mute expression. END
BEGIN NOW What other infantile memories had he of her? END
BEGIN NOW 15 June 1889. END
BEGIN NOW A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and
lessen congestion. END
BEGIN NOW A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her
moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a
doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had
blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian
army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy. END
BEGIN NOW What endemic characteristics were present? END
BEGIN NOW Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line
of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals
to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals. END
BEGIN NOW What memories had he of her adolescence? END
BEGIN NOW She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. END
BEGIN NOW On the duke's lawn,
entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and
take away her photographic image (objection not stated). END
BEGIN NOW On the South
Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of
sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly
back (reason of change not stated). END
BEGIN NOW On the vigil of the 15th anniversary
of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making
a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated). END
BEGIN NOW Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him? END
BEGIN NOW Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped. END
BEGIN NOW What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,
if differently? END
BEGIN NOW A temporary departure of his cat. END
BEGIN NOW Why similarly, why differently? END
BEGIN NOW Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male

(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). END
BEGIN NOW Differently, because
of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation. END
BEGIN NOW In other respects were their differences similar? END
BEGIN NOW In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in
unexpectedness. END
BEGIN NOW As? END
BEGIN NOW Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for
her (cf neckarching cat). END
BEGIN NOW Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in
Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit,
describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy
of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf
mousewatching cat). END
BEGIN NOW Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences
of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf
earwashing cat). END
BEGIN NOW Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an
unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been
Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it
(he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). END
BEGIN NOW Hence, in
passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness,
their differences were similar. END
BEGIN NOW In what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as
matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her? END
BEGIN NOW As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of
vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the
pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in
terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise
moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence
per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter
indicator were at the same angle of inclination, VIDELICET, 5 5/11
minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression. END
BEGIN NOW In what manners did she reciprocate? END
BEGIN NOW She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him
a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware. END
BEGIN NOW She
provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been
made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities,
anticipating his desires. END
BEGIN NOW She admired: a natural phenomenon having been
explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess
without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the
quarter, a thousandth part. END
BEGIN NOW What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make
to Stephen, noctambulist? END
BEGIN NOW To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of
his host and hostess. END
BEGIN NOW What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation
of such an extemporisation? END
BEGIN NOW For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. END
BEGIN NOW For the host:
rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. END
BEGIN NOW For the hostess:
disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian
pronunciation. END
BEGIN NOW Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's
daughter? END
BEGIN NOW Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through
daughter. END
BEGIN NOW To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest
return a monosyllabic negative answer? END
BEGIN NOW If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney
Parade railway station, 14 October 1903. END
BEGIN NOW What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the
host? END
BEGIN NOW A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment
of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the
anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag). END
BEGIN NOW Was the proposal of asylum accepted? END
BEGIN NOW Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined. END
BEGIN NOW What exchange of money took place between host and guest? END
BEGIN NOW The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money
(1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to
the former. END
BEGIN NOW What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed? END
BEGIN NOW To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the
residence of the instructed. END
BEGIN NOW To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction,
place the residence of the instructress. END
BEGIN NOW To inaugurate a series of static
semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence
of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the
Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery,
proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the
National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public
garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more
public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn
between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different
places). END
BEGIN NOW What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually
selfexcluding propositions? END
BEGIN NOW The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's
circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured
clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in
the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly
declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's)
papa. END
BEGIN NOW The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he
(Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge
and tendered it m payment of an account due to and received by J. and T.
Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on
the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return. END
BEGIN NOW Was the clown Bloom's son? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Had Bloom's coin returned? END
BEGIN NOW Never. END
BEGIN NOW Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him? END
BEGIN NOW Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
international animosity. END
BEGIN NOW He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating
these conditions? END
BEGIN NOW There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of
which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth,
through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to
decay. END
BEGIN NOW Why did he desist from speculation? END
BEGIN NOW Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena
to be removed. END
BEGIN NOW Did Stephen participate in his dejection? END
BEGIN NOW He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational
reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the
incertitude of the void. END
BEGIN NOW Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW Not verbally. END
BEGIN NOW Substantially. END
BEGIN NOW What comforted his misapprehension? END
BEGIN NOW That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from
the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void. END
BEGIN NOW In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus
from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected? END
BEGIN NOW Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
BLOOM
Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
STEPHEN:


With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm? END
BEGIN NOW The 113th, MODUS PEREGRINUS: IN EXITU ISRAEL DE EGYPTO: DOMUS JACOB DE
POPULO BARBARO. END
BEGIN NOW What did each do at the door of egress? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen put the hat on his head. END
BEGIN NOW For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress? END
BEGIN NOW For a cat. END
BEGIN NOW What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest,
emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere
of the house into the penumbra of the garden? END
BEGIN NOW The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit. END
BEGIN NOW With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his
companion of various constellations? END
BEGIN NOW Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft
deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius
(alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant
and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the
precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and
nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund
and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging
towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic
drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from
immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with
which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a
parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity. END
BEGIN NOW Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast? END
BEGIN NOW Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the
earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in
cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of
microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable
trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by
cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of
human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes
of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its
universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible
in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever
diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried
far enough, nought nowhere was never reached. END
BEGIN NOW Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result? END
BEGIN NOW Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of
the quadrature of the circle he had learned of .the existence of a number
computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of
so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the
result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages
each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be
requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed
integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds
of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions,
the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing
succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic
elaboration of any power of any of its powers. END
BEGIN NOW Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their
satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and
moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution? END
BEGIN NOW Of a different order of difficulty. END
BEGIN NOW Conscious that the human organism,
normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when
elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere
suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the
line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated
from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing
this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis
which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and
differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist
otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian
or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean
humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences
resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as
here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities
of vanities and to all that is vanity. END
BEGIN NOW And the problem of possible redemption? END
BEGIN NOW The minor was proved by the major. END
BEGIN NOW Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered? END
BEGIN NOW The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,
yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their
magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the
waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular
cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the
interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous
discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,
Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of
distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite
compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and
reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of
meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth
of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers
about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, lo August): the
monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms:
the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a
star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day
(a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in
incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of
William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting
constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar
origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared
from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of
the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar
origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared
from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of
Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years
after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other
constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other
persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from
immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity
of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals,
persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of
human beings. END
BEGIN NOW His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing
for possible error? END
BEGIN NOW That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a
heavenman. END
BEGIN NOW That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the
known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of
different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,
remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a
present before its probable spectators had entered actual present
existence. END
BEGIN NOW Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle? END
BEGIN NOW Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection
invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the
satellite of their planet. END
BEGIN NOW Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
influences upon sublunary disasters? END
BEGIN NOW It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the
nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to
verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the
sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity. END
BEGIN NOW What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
woman? END
BEGIN NOW Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian
generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her
luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and
setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative
interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power
to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to
incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage:
the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent
propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her
light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her
arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when
invisible. END
BEGIN NOW What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's,
gaze? END
BEGIN NOW In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a
paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller
blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving
shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street. END
BEGIN NOW How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his
wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp? END
BEGIN NOW With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued
affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with
suggestion. END
BEGIN NOW Both then were silent? END
BEGIN NOW Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal
flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces. END
BEGIN NOW Were they indefinitely inactive? END
BEGIN NOW At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, then
Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of
micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition,
their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected
luminous and semiluminous shadow. END
BEGIN NOW Similarly? END
BEGIN NOW The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations
were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of
the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year
at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest
altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210
scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of
the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent
vesical pressure. END
BEGIN NOW What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the
invisible audible collateral organ of the other? END
BEGIN NOW To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity,
dimension, sanitariness, pilosity. END
BEGIN NOW To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised
(I January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from
unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine
prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of
the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine
excrescences as hair and toenails. END
BEGIN NOW What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed? END
BEGIN NOW A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament
from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress
of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo. END
BEGIN NOW How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal
departer? END
BEGIN NOW By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an
unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and
turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple,
pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing
an aperture for free egress and free ingress. END
BEGIN NOW How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation? END
BEGIN NOW Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its
base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and
forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles. END
BEGIN NOW What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their
(respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands? END
BEGIN NOW The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells
in the church of Saint George. END
BEGIN NOW What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard? END
BEGIN NOW By Stephen:


    LILIATA RUTILANTIUM. END
BEGIN NOW TURMA CIRCUMDET. END
BEGIN NOW IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM. END
BEGIN NOW CHORUS EXCIPIAT. END
BEGIN NOW By Bloom:


    HEIGHO, HEIGHO,
    HEIGHO, HEIGHO. END
BEGIN NOW Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day
at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to
Glasnevin in the north? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed),
Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry
Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy
Dignam (in the grave). END
BEGIN NOW Alone, what did Bloom hear? END
BEGIN NOW The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the
double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane. END
BEGIN NOW Alone, what did Bloom feel? END
BEGIN NOW The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point
or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Reaumur: the incipient
intimations of proximate dawn. END
BEGIN NOW Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind
him? END
BEGIN NOW Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy
Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,
Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin
Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis,
Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount). END
BEGIN NOW What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain? END
BEGIN NOW The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the
apparition of a new solar disk. END
BEGIN NOW Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena? END
BEGIN NOW Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of
Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the
diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of
Mizrach, the east. END
BEGIN NOW He remembered the initial paraphenomena? END
BEGIN NOW More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at
various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the
visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first
golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon. END
BEGIN NOW Did he remain? END
BEGIN NOW With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering
the passage, reclosing the door. END
BEGIN NOW With brief suspiration he reassumed the
candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room,
hallfloor, and reentered. END
BEGIN NOW What suddenly arrested his ingress? END
BEGIN NOW The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible
fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in
consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered. END
BEGIN NOW Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of
furniture. END
BEGIN NOW A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the
door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration
which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker
inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the
place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting
angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from
its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous
position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and
left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table. END
BEGIN NOW Describe them. END
BEGIN NOW One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted
to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular
fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered
seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. END
BEGIN NOW The other: a
slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite
the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being
varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited
rush. END
BEGIN NOW What significances attached to these two chairs? END
BEGIN NOW Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial
evidence, of testimonial supermanence. END
BEGIN NOW What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard? END
BEGIN NOW A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin
supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray
containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two
discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the
key of G natural for voice and piano of LOVE'S OLD SWEET SONG (words by
G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette
Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications AD LIBITUM,
FORTE, pedal, ANIMATO, sustained pedal, RITIRANDO, close. END
BEGIN NOW With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects? END
BEGIN NOW With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right
temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a
large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,
bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the
gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act
and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the
consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual
discolouration. END
BEGIN NOW His next proceeding? END
BEGIN NOW From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black
diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a
small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the
mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it
superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin
of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to
facilitate total combustion. END
BEGIN NOW What followed this operation? END
BEGIN NOW The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense. END
BEGIN NOW What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
mantelpiece? END
BEGIN NOW A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46
a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf
tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial
gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
Alderman John Hooper. END
BEGIN NOW What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. END
BEGIN NOW Before the
mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear
melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while
Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze
regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle. END
BEGIN NOW What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
attention? END
BEGIN NOW The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man. END
BEGIN NOW Why solitary (ipsorelative)? END
BEGIN NOW BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAD HE NONE. END
BEGIN NOW YET THAT MAN'S FATHER WAS HIS GRANDFATHER'S SON. END
BEGIN NOW Why mutable (aliorelative)? END
BEGIN NOW From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. END
BEGIN NOW From
maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
procreator. END
BEGIN NOW What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror? END
BEGIN NOW The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on
the two bookshelves opposite. END
BEGIN NOW Catalogue these books. END

  perfon who should find it, if the book should be loft or go aftray,
  to reftore it to Michael Gallagher, carpenter, Dufery Gate,
  Ennifcorthy, county Wicklow, the fineft place in the world. END
BEGIN NOW What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the
inverted volumes? END
BEGIN NOW The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its
place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the
incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella
inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document
behind, beneath or between the pages of a book. END
BEGIN NOW Which volume was the largest in bulk? END
BEGIN NOW Hozier's HISTORY OF THE RUSSO-TURKISH WAR. END
BEGIN NOW What among other data did the second volume of the work in question

BEGIN NOW The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a
decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered). END
BEGIN NOW Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question? END
BEGIN NOW Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult
the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the
military engagement, Plevna. END
BEGIN NOW What caused him consolation in his sitting posture? END
BEGIN NOW The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased
by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk. END
BEGIN NOW What caused him irritation in his sitting posture? END
BEGIN NOW Inhibitory pressure of
collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing
superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations
of mass by expansion. END
BEGIN NOW How was the irritation allayed? END
BEGIN NOW He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud,
from his neck to a position on the left of the table. END
BEGIN NOW He unbuttoned
successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest
along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in
triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of
the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to
the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae, thence produced both
ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two
equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary
prominences. END
BEGIN NOW He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced
trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete. END
BEGIN NOW What involuntary actions followed? END
BEGIN NOW He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in
the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting
inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. END
BEGIN NOW He
scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of
prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly
abluted skin. END
BEGIN NOW He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his
waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (I shilling), placed
there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of
Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade. END

Did the process of divestiture continue? END
BEGIN NOW Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his
foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient
points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in
several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots,
unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the
second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore
part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his
right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off
his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat
of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the
great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the
odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated
ungual fragment. END
BEGIN NOW Why with satisfaction? END
BEGIN NOW Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
ungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs
Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief
genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation. END
BEGIN NOW In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions
now coalesced? END
BEGIN NOW Not to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English,
or possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of
acres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation 42 pounds), of

BEGIN NOW What facilities of transit were desirable? END
BEGIN NOW When citybound frequent connection by train or tram from their respective

BEGIN NOW When countrybound velocipedes, a
chainless freewheel roadster cycle with side basketcar attached, or

working solidungular cob (roan gelding, 14 h). END
BEGIN NOW What might be the name of this erigible or erected residence? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom Cottage. END
BEGIN NOW Saint Leopold's. END
BEGIN NOW Flowerville. END
BEGIN NOW Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville? END
BEGIN NOW In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful
garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young
firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a
weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent
of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving
longevity. END

BEGIN NOW Snapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative
to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the
celestial constellations. END
BEGIN NOW What lighter recreations? END

vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection
of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers' fires of
smoking peat turves (period of hibernation). END
BEGIN NOW Indoor: discussion in tepid
security of unsolved historical and criminal problems: lecture of
unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox
containing hammer, awl nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers,
bullnose plane and turnscrew. END
BEGIN NOW Might he become a gentleman farmer of field
produce and live stock? END
BEGIN NOW Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and
requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper
etc. END
BEGIN NOW What would be his civic functions and social status among the county
families and landed gentry? END
BEGIN NOW Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that of
gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his
career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest
and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto (SEMPER PARATUS), duly
recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C., K. P.,
L. L. D. (HONORIS CAUSA), Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in court and
fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown
for England). END
BEGIN NOW What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity? END
BEGIN NOW A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the
dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly

he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of

estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader,
a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing
those of Rothschild or the silver king. END
BEGIN NOW What would render such return irrational? END
BEGIN NOW An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through
reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible
time. END

BEGIN NOW What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were
perceived by him? END
BEGIN NOW A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new violet
garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous
lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes
and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a
camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of
blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the
top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners,
with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering
B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy). END
BEGIN NOW What impersonal objects were perceived? END
BEGIN NOW A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting,
apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat. END
BEGIN NOW Orangekeyed ware,
bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery
manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the
washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on
the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor,
separate). END
BEGIN NOW Bloom's acts? END
BEGIN NOW He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining
articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the
bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the
proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the
foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed. END
BEGIN NOW How? END
BEGIN NOW With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not
his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being
old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under
stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or
adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception
and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of
sleep and of death. END
BEGIN NOW What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter? END
BEGIN NOW New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,
female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,
some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed. END
BEGIN NOW If he had smiled why would he have smiled? END
BEGIN NOW To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if
the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,
last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor
alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity. END
BEGIN NOW What preceding series? END
BEGIN NOW Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell
d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father
Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show,
Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of
Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an
unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus,
Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper,
Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the
General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no
last term. END
BEGIN NOW What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and
late occupant of the bed? END
BEGIN NOW Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a
billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a
boaster). END
BEGIN NOW Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal
proportion and commercial ability? END
BEGIN NOW Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding
members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire,
finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension
and apprehension. END
BEGIN NOW With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
affected? END
BEGIN NOW Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity. END
BEGIN NOW Envy? END
BEGIN NOW Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston
and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a
constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental
female organism, passive but not obtuse. END
BEGIN NOW Jealousy? END
BEGIN NOW Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the
agent and reagent of attraction. END
BEGIN NOW Because attraction between agent(s) and
reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase
and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. END
BEGIN NOW Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction
produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Abnegation? END
BEGIN NOW In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden
Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and
reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of
ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)
extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative,
e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net
proceeds divided. END
BEGIN NOW Equanimity? END
BEGIN NOW As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance
with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. END
BEGIN NOW As not
so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence
of a collision with a dark sun. END
BEGIN NOW As less reprehensible than theft, highway
robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false
pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money,
betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors,
criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony,
mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of
unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury,
poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation,
criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. END
BEGIN NOW As not
more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered
conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between
the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages,
acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. END
BEGIN NOW As more than
inevitable, irreparable. END
BEGIN NOW Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity? END
BEGIN NOW From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially
violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the
adulterously violated. END
BEGIN NOW What retribution, if any? END
BEGIN NOW Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. END
BEGIN NOW Duel by
combat, no. END
BEGIN NOW Divorce, not now. END
BEGIN NOW Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic
bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. END
BEGIN NOW Suit
for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of
injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. END
BEGIN NOW Hushmoney by moral
influence possibly. END
BEGIN NOW If any, positively, connivance, introduction of
emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a
successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation,
humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other,
protecting the separator from both. END
BEGIN NOW By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of
incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments? END
BEGIN NOW The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility
of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the
selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the
selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done; the fallaciously inferred
debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of
ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving
no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as
masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct
feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist
preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and
quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary
masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of
seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by
distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the
inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy
of the stars. END
BEGIN NOW In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and
reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge? END
BEGIN NOW Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial
hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored
(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of
Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female
hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and
seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,
insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,
expressive of mute immutable mature animality. END
BEGIN NOW The visible signs of antesatisfaction? END
BEGIN NOW An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a
tentative revelation: a silent contemplation. END
BEGIN NOW Then? END
BEGIN NOW He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each
plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure
prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation. END
BEGIN NOW The visible signs of postsatisfaction? END
BEGIN NOW A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a
solicitous aversion: a proximate erection. END
BEGIN NOW What followed this silent action? END
BEGIN NOW Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,
catechetical interrogation. END
BEGIN NOW With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation? END
BEGIN NOW Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in
the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited,
8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response
thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. END
BEGIN NOW Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmer of
LEAH at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an
invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36 and 37 Lower
Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entituled
SWEETS OF SIN, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary
concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of a
postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered)
being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of
Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by
him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author
aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility. END
BEGIN NOW Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications? END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Dedalus, professor and author. END
BEGIN NOW What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were
perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the
course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration? END
BEGIN NOW By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been
celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
September 1870), viz. END
BEGIN NOW 8 October, and consummated on the same date with
female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on
the lo September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with
ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken
place 5 weeks previous, viz. END
BEGIN NOW 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29
December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,
aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days
during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation
of semen within the natural female organ. END
BEGIN NOW By the narrator a limitation of
activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse
between himself and the listener had not taken place since the
consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female
issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a
period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a
preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of
action had been circumscribed. END
BEGIN NOW How? END
BEGIN NOW By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for
which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected
or effected. END
BEGIN NOW What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible
thoughts? END
BEGIN NOW The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow. END
BEGIN NOW In what directions did listener and narrator lie? END
BEGIN NOW Listener, S. E. by E.: Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of
latitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45
degrees to the terrestrial equator. END
BEGIN NOW In what state of rest or motion? END
BEGIN NOW At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. END
BEGIN NOW In motion being each
and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the
proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of
neverchanging space. END
BEGIN NOW In what posture? END
BEGIN NOW Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg
extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the
attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. END
BEGIN NOW Narrator:
reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index
finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in
the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the
childman weary, the manchild in the womb. END
BEGIN NOW Womb? END
BEGIN NOW Weary? END
BEGIN NOW He rests. END

Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his
breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the CITY ARMS hotel when he
used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness
to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he
thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for
masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid
to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she
had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end
of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the
women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody
wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look
at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to
cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby
talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to
get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up
under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to
old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of
nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter
with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything
is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and
then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying
there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has
shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when
theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think
it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he
sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I
wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she
could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans
bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on
account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a
man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I
hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his
corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then
wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all
the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway
love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one
of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel
story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who
did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me
see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a
young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked
out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up
to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all
the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate
having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little
bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they
only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was
scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him
Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up
with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very
probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him
because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to
forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool
like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not
that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way
though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under
my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace
padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of
those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting
him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that
one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman
is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants
then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you
please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the
oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common
robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it
takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was
her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I
thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt
lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday
she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled
up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that
better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only
for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow
either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought
he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up
to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew
she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that
long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom
when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by
the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his
like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes
beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool
he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give
him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to
be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some
nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like
me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my
garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I
know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging
drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this
that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because
I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews
temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to
Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me
out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in
your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name
who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him
can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought
to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman
and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then
finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done
now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make
its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think
no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him
first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all
over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me
sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a
kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that
confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and
what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but
whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes
rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom
right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did
you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the
real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to
God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling
it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder
did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of
course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father
died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries
let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the
smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a
priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something
to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing
I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall
though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking
of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it
who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink
not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their
bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and
yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera
hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had
the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep
himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port
and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and
tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped
straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I
thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed
myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as
if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres
no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only
make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars
street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed
scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says
your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know
what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come
3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I
thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst
though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the
blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like
iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have
eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I
never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you
feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making
us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion
driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that
determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he
hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out
and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any
of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me
nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if
someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through
with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys
husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child
or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of
children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger
with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I
was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you
couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they
have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked
having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed
have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes
thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the
funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think
what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a
bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the
night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down
my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was
why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said
about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman
is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for
giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he
said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still
he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside
I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that
family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was
crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her
over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he
asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the
present of Byron's poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished
that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id
even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her
somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways
ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil
and gloves on going out I kiss then would send them all spinning however
alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too
delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much
mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in
the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a
declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me
though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him
for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he
was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling
the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him
off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty
flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams
so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be
always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course
glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible
asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to
that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking
a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the
kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very
handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked
though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got
engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits
of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling
out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great
humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant
because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all
but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt
darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like
now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face
beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must
have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was
edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to
run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go
to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine
having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any
moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow
whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or
shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat
when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his
slippers to look for 10000 pounds for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May
wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually
too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man
like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of
course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I
do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of
his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I
wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she
the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men
can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in
the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all
that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she
put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I
asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before
she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance
of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do
besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they

theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he
noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C
with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both
ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two
old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what
do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he
made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself
always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I
forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some
robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in
the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom
and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was
looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the
hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them
when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too
tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the
stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold
bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my
foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it
was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black
out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in
Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to
walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural
like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points
in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I
forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man
with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his
face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I
took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of when he
commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods AVE MARIA
what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part
which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my
low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the
way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that
there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill
tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him
there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like
it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt
an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got
me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to
give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along
Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take
it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my
bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw
him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers
thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the
bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and
I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin
standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when
he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me
however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new
raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his
complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing
there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from
anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but
they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him
coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping
away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I
halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my
glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for
the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers
the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll
to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O MARIA SANTISIMA he did look a
big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry
to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on
with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in
the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat
you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for
it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers
outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him
from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he
circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do
everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting
all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the
butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that
letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman
after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking
me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he
had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always
breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and
if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont
understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to
be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with
that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young
then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way
he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8
big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my
heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel
like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner
I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people
who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then
its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy
kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the
concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed
with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright
yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more
respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind
like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending
the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with
nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his
tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was l/4
after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know
the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to
get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for
England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I
love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing
then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to
Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did
suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling
went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with
him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough
knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do
something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me
telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its
better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him
the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup
for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with
the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and
the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion
for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two
gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too
hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job
he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken
us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love
jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he
take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping
the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at
us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an
exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage
that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him l or 2
tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer
then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped
with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where
its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits
of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account
of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and
wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy
not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past
him like he got me on to sing in the STABAT MATER by going around saying
he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the
jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on
copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them
Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual
trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck
is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it
thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a
boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria
and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd
East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just
the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely
the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was
pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he
couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made
their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other
old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for
years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was
even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment
pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it
was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of
the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black
Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the
prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the
Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses
for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after
what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono
things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with
them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those
things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning
and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round
the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were
married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care
he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get
it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit
washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror
never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that
all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for
this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into
me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like
the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he
so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the
way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish
tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly well off
I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a
perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress
tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he
said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on
account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he
was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long
joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me
with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at
dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have
picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and
browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything
on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish
I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was
playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a
restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful
for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the
way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at
least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind
of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the
girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that
Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she
hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one
days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and
kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself
and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one
of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman
with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good
what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that
unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly
is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I
getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a
pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel
he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm
off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for
fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I
wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so
much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore
today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no
there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my
skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same
place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said
to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to
wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax
and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the
skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger
after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry
handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without
style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell
you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot
measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like
those new shoes yes how much were they Ive no clothes at all the brown
costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that
for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men
wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no
man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years
more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all Ill be 33 in
September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older
than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she
was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist
tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I
did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it
and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and
that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I
suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a
king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a
beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous
old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her
wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had
the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books
he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a
priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a
nice word for any priest to write and her a--e as if any fool wouldnt
know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old
blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and
Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50
the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord
flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up
about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was
over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed
Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her
and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to
the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt
honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found
lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in
his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I
wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry
few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something
where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a
throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering
about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme
today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man
or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have
been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and
patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave
me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief
really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old
rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it
but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I
knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd
and Bums as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage
sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing
kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans
dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into
it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me
yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles
off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my
backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton
street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever
she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much
trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully
stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy
pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at
my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to
show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without
making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being
supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that
way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were

yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he
made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow
stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and
Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what
are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in
case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like
those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her
hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like
with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or
sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a
cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or
that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of
the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing
out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own
they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always
trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens
greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or
other trying to catch my eye as if it was I of the 7 wonders of the world
O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy
after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and
watery I went into r of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when
was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a
couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place
meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a
sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a
kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats
admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich
fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling
the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath
of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like
that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about
like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in
it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never
can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and
burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much
theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I
had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great
breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he
said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the
morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the
Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I
snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used
to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna
prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it
was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea
well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the
budget if I only could remember the I half of the things and write a book
out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin
much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big
infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure
those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch
myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come
again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he
made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was
coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after
O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything
at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the
way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like
him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the
contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair
a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the
savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant
wait till Monday

frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines
have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of
them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that
have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those
roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those
old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes
getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C Ill get
him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next
year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys
paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the
place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my
beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the
heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of
the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 Rock
mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the
poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those
tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that
lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris
what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats
this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present
have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it
wogger she called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear
you sing Waiting and in old Madrid Concone is the name of those exercises
he bought me one of those new some word I couldnt make out shawls amusing
things but tear for the least thing still there lovely I think dont you
will always think of the lovely teas we had together scrumptious currant
scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina be sure
and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also captain
Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married
just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond
of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the
bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear
these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk
up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant
do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats
why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the
banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the
brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their
nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor
horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break
his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it
sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of
them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones
of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to
compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle
it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on
a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the
night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we
were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me
whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when
I was with father and captain Grove I looked up at the church first and
then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go
through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I
looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was
attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent
looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the
shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement
like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on
account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the
Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne
I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that
other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I
wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs
Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them
like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always
shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this
blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent
nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his
fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift
drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair
when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa
cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and
the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems
centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address
right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always
going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats
with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers
uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very
serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she
kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it
my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of
some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very
peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as
the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it
somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting
always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying
feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially
the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you
didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did
supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the
consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in
mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning
and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking
about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews
in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for
the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock
the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking
about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at
Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken
old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it
picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in
a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of
the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky
talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I
suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a
letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits
of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening
to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing
his heah heah aheah all my compriments on your hotchapotch of your heass
as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if
there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles
street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window
to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never
understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for
them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise
me either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where
does their great intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they
have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the
City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows
they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying
to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of
paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor
man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some
advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam
only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a
letter to him who did I get the last letter from O Mrs Dwenn now what
possessed her to write from Canada after so many years to know the recipe
I had for pisto madrileno Floey Dillon since she wrote to say she was
married to a very rich architect if Im to believe all I hear with a villa
and eight rooms her father was an awfully nice man he was near seventy
always goodhumoured well now Miss Tweedy or Miss Gillespie theres the
piannyer that was a solid silver coffee service he had too on the
mahogany sideboard then dying so far away I hate people that have always
their poor story to tell everybody has their own troubles that poor Nancy
Blake died a month ago of acute neumonia well I didnt know her so well as
all that she was Floeys friend more than mine poor Nancy its a bother
having to answer he always tells me the wrong things and no stops to say

mistake and newphew with 2 double yous in I hope hell write me a longer
letter the next time if its a thing he really likes me O thanks be to the
great God I got somebody to give me what I badly wanted to put some heart
up into me youve no chances at all in this place like you used long ago I
wish somebody would write me a loveletter his wasnt much and I told him
he could write what he liked yours ever Hugh Boylan in old Madrid stuff
silly women believe love is sighing I am dying still if he wrote it I
suppose thered be some truth in it true or no it fills up your whole day
and life always something to think about every moment and see it all
round you like a new world I could write the answer in bed to let him
imagine me short just a few words not those long crossed letters Atty
Dillon used to write to the fellow that was something in the four courts
that jilted her after out of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to
say a few simple words he could twist how he liked not acting with
precipat precip itancy with equal candour the greatest earthly happiness
answer to a gentlemans proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing
else its all very fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre
old they might as well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit. END
BEGIN NOW Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio
brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her
to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin
to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in
the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her
appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles
with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the
Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack
flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took
all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in
Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was
a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed
virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday
morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the
vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he
signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw
him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped
me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I
had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and
corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the
handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a
white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time
he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when
a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue
in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few
times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to
the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he
believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a
true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I
told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls
he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he
crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the
pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he
said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left
May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like
that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under
the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and
all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail
careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a
regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and
throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that
white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could
without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was
tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the
highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful
rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them
hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the
way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships
out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the
sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them
outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over
him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left
side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind
of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with
his for a moment but I wouldnt lee him he was awfully put out first for
fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that
old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all
after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get
lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a
woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad
to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far
enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes
because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did
we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief
pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch
me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I
tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog
in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below
us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush
a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his
out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons
men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me
what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant
he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to
the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said
hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed
do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now
flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20
years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his
hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still
about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite
changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little
knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in
broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they
could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild
after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros
and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming
coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old
guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on
them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what
to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often
as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop
that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions
about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new
woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre
called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used
to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or
practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming
Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or
Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom
or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or
suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have
given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita
Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting
in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and
dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up
the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper
trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at
him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make
to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze
or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up
somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with
captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed
have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris
and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco
almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it
and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking
of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to
slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under
my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in
that Gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink
on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me
that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south
Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they
were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like
an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it
was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog
shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour
Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner
yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that
train again weeping tone once in the dear deaead days beyondre call close
my eyes breath my lips forward kiss sad look eyes open piano ere oer the
world the mists began I hate that istsbeg comes loves sweet

pardon coach I thought you were a wheelbarrow theyd die down dead off
their feet if ever they got a chance of walking down the Alameda on an
officers arm like me on the bandnight my eyes flash my bust that they
havent passion God help their poor head I knew more about men and life
when I was I S than theyll all know at 50 they dont know how to sing a
song like that Gardner said no man could look at my mouth and teeth
smiling like that and not think of it I was afraid he mightnt like my
accent first he so English all father left me in spite of his stamps Ive
my mothers eyes and figure anyhow he always said theyre so snotty about
themselves some of those cads he wasnt a bit like that he was dead gone
on my lips let them get a husband first thats fit to be looked at and a
daughter like mine or see if they can excite a swell with money that can
pick and choose whoever he wants like Boylan to do it 4 or 5 times locked
in each others arms or the voice either I could have been a prima donna
only I married him comes looooves old deep down chin back not too much
make it double My Ladys Bower is too long for an encore about the moated
grange at twilight and vaunted rooms yes Ill sing Winds that blow from
the south that he gave after the choirstairs performance Ill change that
lace on my black dress to show off my bubs and Ill yes by God Ill get
that big fan mended make them burst with envy my hole is itching me
always when I think of him I feel I want to I feel some wind in me better
go easy not wake him have him at it again slobbering after washing every
bit of myself back belly and sides if we had even a bath itself or my own
room anyway I wish hed sleep in some bed by himself with his cold feet on
me give us room even to let a fart God or do the least thing better yes
hold them like that a bit on my side piano quietly sweeeee theres that
train far away pianissimo eeeee one more song

that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that
pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I
couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the
porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my
nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I
couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I
so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more
company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about
ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her
up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the
something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit
of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then
make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there
the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my
skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand
dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put
out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this
night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading
him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it
must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they
find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and
drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for
eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have
him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the
spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to
hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the
tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake
I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking
but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring
like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as
I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh place I bought I think
Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some
blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of
mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods
goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a
nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im
sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg
beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is
enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or let him pay it and
invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the
furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses
toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes
with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down
at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he
says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes
out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit
him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat
with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if
anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes
then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the
weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left
and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar
slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim
of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his
flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all
the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black
and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I
dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms
hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt
wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love
lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he
brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock
I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube
from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all
ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy
and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea
excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the
back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old
Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with
the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I
suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being
alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put
up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the
confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor
drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and
ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the
things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him
telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by
moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out
of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I
liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man
will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim
for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know
what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a
tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that
picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20
years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money
imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run
miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and
windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison
or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big
brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her
bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better
than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he
went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for
a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much
noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to
steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with
Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to
take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to
Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all IS at
school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and
Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans
everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I
bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking
first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself
there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all
day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew
she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness
and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to
mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the
potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he
was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the
paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his
side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a
matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything
wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished
out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see
well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons
imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her
can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out
of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as
well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting
to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose
I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I
sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell
you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting
and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter
what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is
open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I
had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the
windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me
when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great
touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take
your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life
Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in
theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to
you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the
last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or
her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit
daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies
outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the
moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt
even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell
get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down
with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of
course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was
what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls
nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on
black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain
came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for
breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be
real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I
suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it
though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a
particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays
full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre
usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer
to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt
lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have
wanting to put her hair up at I S my powder too only ruin her skin on her
shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless
knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I
was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me
like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the
day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not
to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough
till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that
now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me
that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because
how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before
cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave
knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she
said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last
time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent
order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us
slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to
have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to
let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs
Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into
her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she
cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got
lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area
window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them
like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have
been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with
his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great
big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got
all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine
climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he
didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature
gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen
now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair
of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for
all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on
them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down
the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her
paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them
disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its
drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every
day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im
stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to
get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me
yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and
ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday
wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do
God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks
usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me
like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave
him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did
about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt
give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his
glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul
thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all
in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out
then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry
supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery
hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman
in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it
I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off
than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its
pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as
he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the
clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want
to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats
troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40
times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too
purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever
suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and
children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they
could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to
put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it
nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me
there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great
suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to
see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its
breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting
on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off
only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he
oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those
kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out
straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre
bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it
in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs
than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there
between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being
a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like
the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore

who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I
something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was
it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the
doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white
thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr
Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I
suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round
those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little
fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so
theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the
world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling
around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an
offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe
what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him
with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it
easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the
way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like
letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull
the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres
something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a
child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that
how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent
omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have
omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt
trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I
liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his
nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no
matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course
that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one
everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that
comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got
out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5
times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am
quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only
natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night
ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one
another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account
of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things
he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he
was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to
believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me
that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be
more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once
explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you
enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st
opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom
pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk
and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I
laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting
on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman
could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in
all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes
sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its
well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his
hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday
in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his
side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger
religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia
imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to
sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes
mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah
yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes
sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him
great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this
nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the
other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight
now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he
scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from
Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told
him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16
years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario
terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling
every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march
pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the
City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on
the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks
after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting
on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys
and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over
his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and
gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the
Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the
freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along
in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much
consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed
judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges
church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well thats a nice
hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down
into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit
tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that
French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know
deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why
should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then
tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he
brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life
without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more
with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the
kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in
their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea
and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im
nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one
night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half
the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them
and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I
thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong
too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont
know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he
doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the
blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes
such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman
thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him
that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some
little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the
College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his
nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those
two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of
course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy
Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper
Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something
reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom
and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off
falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin
Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of
cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed
want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck
as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see
it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying
one another and they all with their wives and families at home more
especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is
always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a
goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre
a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into
their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I
know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough
not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks
after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same
Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do
unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub
corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home
her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming
though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree
dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the
swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into
them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs
botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a
spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that
to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was
always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old
love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn
bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him
at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe
dearest goodbye sweetheart SWEETheart he always sang it not like Bartell
Darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there
was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood
flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register
even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then
hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I
wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a
university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving
at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it
taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it
I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after
all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his
father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11
though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one
thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the
deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into
mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an
innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit
and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons
he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on
he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a
young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant
him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned
the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a
journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3
queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came
out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream
something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt
long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian
what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their
poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought
he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I
thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88
I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons
5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23
or 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he
wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa
and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told
him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope
hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John
Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he
wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where
poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully
coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point
the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there
again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him
theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as
loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a
change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about
yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad
and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we
have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like
that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I
could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock
standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging
into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some
consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could
look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for
you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted
to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt
mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you
to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too
in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or
the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs
of men I suppose never dream of washing it from I years end to the other
the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure
itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age
Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard
comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill
read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who
he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same
and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he
half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly
too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but
then what am I going to do about him though

no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no
nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I
didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage
thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off
his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without
even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a
shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old
hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his
way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what
with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an
old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and
tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself
sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a
womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one
myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on
you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John
has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of
Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and
they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either
its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy
etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men
again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman
or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses
round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not
going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their
stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead
of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well
naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he
does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair
Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband
or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we
given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young
still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time
living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes
asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd
kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything
unnatural where we havent I atom of any kind of expression in us all of
us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the
dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita
theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a
madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a
woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young
no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the
fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would
I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me
and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a
pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those
wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the
Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent
mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over
and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with
the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up
against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do
themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up
somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the
fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was
for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I
turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming
out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after
that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with
disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike
listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep
and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came
out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man
in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does
that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get
his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed
did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them
attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd
be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you
wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do
you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every
penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she
does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all
only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how
could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to
look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now
out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on
account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those
that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not
able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching
the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that
disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that
little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor
child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we
were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms
about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the
time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the
city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother
wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still
its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the
air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he
wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you
I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a
dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us
so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa
in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young
hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah
what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz
Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of
Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las
Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a
name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O
my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers
ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me
if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a
day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the
Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten
it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any
person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous
Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the
two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish
and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity
he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good
sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit
of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the
woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and
tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could
bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all
right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me
all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very
funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half
awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord
the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing
he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed
in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in
there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed
in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for I he can make it
for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if
he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with
an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red
slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice
semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing
jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give
him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old
bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables
and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits
all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet
theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are
and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to
melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill
throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make
his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do
Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa
pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu
forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out
of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he
wanted that his wife is I s l o fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to
my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his
spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought
to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him
stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and
make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault
if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if
thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not
much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is
supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so
attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my
drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick
his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell
him I want LI or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes
then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it
all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine
cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few
times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it
off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose
that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions Ill know by
the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every
turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words
smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then
Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay
and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing
pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum
and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be
more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good
enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a
business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the
ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a
quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in
China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns
ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except
an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at
cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze
off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars
the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was
like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and
try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside
Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in
case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky
day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think
while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him
first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I
wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a
rich big shop at 7 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them
and the pinky sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the
middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them
not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in
roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then
the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields
of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going
about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers
all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the
ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no
God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why
dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever
they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then
they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre
afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well
who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that
made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they
might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for
you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head
in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to
me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was
leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near
lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are
flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life
and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I
saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get
round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he
asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the
sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey
and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the
sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they
called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with
the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish
girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in
the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who
else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all
clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep
and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and
the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of
years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like
kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with
the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her
lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the
castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman
going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and
the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and
the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets
