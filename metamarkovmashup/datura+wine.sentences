BEGIN NOW Ever since I heard of Datura from a friend at school a few years ago, I have always tried to get a hold of some, asking dealers I knew from around town. END
BEGIN NOW But I was never successful, as many people I asked didn't even know what it was. END
BEGIN NOW So after awhile I gave up hope and continued with the usual, smoking grass everyday, occasionally scoring some ketamine or opium to make life a little more interesting. END
BEGIN NOW Then last year I finally got a chance to try the stuff. END
BEGIN NOW One of my friends told me he had gone to stay with his grandparents for a week and noticed a plant near their house that looked a lot like Datura, so he went over to it and sure enough he saw the small, spikey pods growing near the bottom of the plant. END
BEGIN NOW He himself didnt want to try any because he always feared any sort of hallucinogen because of the risk of a bad trip, but knew I had been wanting to try it for quite some time, so he picked one of the magical pods and wrapped it up in cellophane and brought them back for me. END
BEGIN NOW The bastard wouldnt hand them over unless I paid him 20 bucks, but I figured it would be well worth it. END
BEGIN NOW I couldnt wait to try them. END
BEGIN NOW First thing I did was found someone who would be a sitter for me, and that sitter was the most trustworthy friend I know (lets call him Steve). END
BEGIN NOW I asked my mom if he could sleep over and she said it was fine. END
BEGIN NOW So the next day, Steve came over around noon, and I got the seeds out of the pod and counted 37. END
BEGIN NOW I heard it only took like 10 or 15, and I wanted to have more so I could trip another time or sell them, so I decided to take 15. END
BEGIN NOW T:00.00 - Me and Steve went up to my room to take them. END
BEGIN NOW We put on some music and sat down in my bean bag chairs. END
BEGIN NOW I was feeling confident that things were going to go smoothly, mostly just because Steve was there with me, he was a very responsible person who I felt very safe and secure with. END
BEGIN NOW Of course I had a little butterflies in my stomach because I was taking something new, but it was mostly excitement, a total 'I cant wait' feeling. END
BEGIN NOW As Steve and I talked, I decided it was time, and pulled the sandwich baggie out of my pocket. END
BEGIN NOW I got all the seeds in my palm and looked at them, little teardrop shaped things, darkish brown, almost black. END
BEGIN NOW I thought to my self 'here goes nothing' and licked my palm to get all the seeds stuck on my tongue, chewed em up a bit, and swallowed. END
BEGIN NOW As they went down I got this overwhelming feeling of 'finally'. END
BEGIN NOW I have finally taken this crazy Datura, and in time I will be experiencing it. END
BEGIN NOW All I could do now is relax, keep the best state of mind I possibly could, and wait for things to kick in. END
BEGIN NOW T:00.30 - Went down to the kitchen with Steve to get a drink of water, and then went to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW No noticeable effects. END
BEGIN NOW Steve suggested we play video games while we wait for it to kick in. END
BEGIN NOW We went back to my room and played Mario Kart 64 and snacked on some doritos. END
BEGIN NOW T:00.50 - Starting to feel different. END
BEGIN NOW A lot like when you need to stretch really bad, but in my whole body. END
BEGIN NOW Mouth is getting dry, very similar to the cottonmouth after smoking a thick blunt. END
BEGIN NOW Steve is winning the game and I am loosing my grip on the controller, and I cant seem to keep the A button pushed down. END
BEGIN NOW After about 10 minutes I feel much different, very intense, and Im wondering why Steve is in my room playing video games. END
BEGIN NOW He reminds me that he is sleeping over to watch me because I took Datura. END
BEGIN NOW Right after he says this a wave of shock and fear run down my body like goosebumps, for I had completely forgotten the reason he was there, and that I had taken anything, although I do recall it, I am needless to say in shock at what just happened with my brain. END
BEGIN NOW I look at Steve and say 'calm me down', and somehow, Steve knew exactly what to do. END
BEGIN NOW He just smiled at me in this reassuring smile and said 'dont worry man, youre gonna have a blast' this made me feel incredibly better, and my mood shifted. END
BEGIN NOW After this, things seem to go back to normal, and I ask Steve to stop playing video games and go downstairs with me. END
BEGIN NOW We go downstairs into my kitchen and I pull a full pitcher of cherry kool-aid from the fridge. END
BEGIN NOW Steve got 2 glasses, then we went into my living room and sat down on the couch. END
BEGIN NOW I pour the both of us a glass and we sip it while watching tv. END
BEGIN NOW Afer I finish my glass I pick up the pitcher and gulp it down halfway. END
BEGIN NOW I am very thirsty, but the drink doesnt seem to quench my thirst at all, it seems to glide over the surface of my mouth, leaving it dry still. END
BEGIN NOW I now just try my best to ignore it, and continue watching tv. END
BEGIN NOW T:01:30 I tell Steve Ill be right back, and walk to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW While I piss I look at this picture above my toilet. END
BEGIN NOW Its a cartoon of a polar bear lying on its back in the water, holding a wine glass like it fell asleep from being drunk. END
BEGIN NOW The concept makes me want to laugh, it seems like the dumbest cartoon in the world to me, and its location is just as random as its contents. END
BEGIN NOW I think to my self 'why the f*** do we have a picture of a drunk polar bear in our bathroom'. END
BEGIN NOW For some reason, this seems near hysterical to me. END
BEGIN NOW I walk out of the bathroom and go back to the couch with Steve. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as I sit down, my mom walked out of the kitchen and tells us shes going to work and to behave, shell be back around 10. END
BEGIN NOW Steve and I say good bye and she leaves. END
BEGIN NOW Perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Now we have the house to ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW T:02:00 - Nothing much more seems to be happening. END
BEGIN NOW I have finished the pitcher of kool-aid and gone to the bathroom 2 more times. END
BEGIN NOW Steve says to go in the kitchen and refill the pitcher with water in case I feel like Im going to dehydrate. END
BEGIN NOW It seems like a responsible idea so I go into the kitchen and refill it with water and put ice cubes in it. END
BEGIN NOW I walk back into my living room to find Steve has left, and the tv has been turned off. END
BEGIN NOW The entire house is dead silent. END
BEGIN NOW Then I hear the tv go back on, but the screen is blank, and I hear Steve saying 'hey Im over here'. END
BEGIN NOW I realize that hes calling me from out in my backyard, so I put my shoes on and go outside. END
BEGIN NOW At first I scanned my back yard for him, but couldnt see him, and I couldnt hear him anymore. END
BEGIN NOW I suddenly get the idea that Steve had come over for a hide and seek game (at this point I have absolutely no idea that I have taken anything) so I run into the yard looking around for him. END
BEGIN NOW Then I speak 'come out come out where ever you are' . END
BEGIN NOW Right when I say this my voice sounds very different, like a person who has gone totally insane. END
BEGIN NOW This starts to scare me very much, and Steve is nowhere to be found. END
BEGIN NOW I look way across to the other end of my yard (my yard is only about a 100 foot by 200 foot area, but now it was a soccer field size) and at the other end I see my dogs pen, a fenced in area in the corner with all my friends who are straight edge that stopped being friends with me when I started smoking pot. END
BEGIN NOW I havent seen them in so long, so I run towards the pen. END
BEGIN NOW They look just as happy to see me as I am to see them, and they let me into the pen. END
BEGIN NOW We start talking and to my surprise, one of them pulls a blunt out of nowhere and sparks it. END
BEGIN NOW I am naturally amused but shocked, then they start to explain to me that they came to see me cause they all 'got into the game' and dont think drugs are that bad after all. END
BEGIN NOW On the outside I am pleased to hear this, but on the inside I begin to get feelings of untrust. END
BEGIN NOW These bastards abandoned me years back. END
BEGIN NOW I dont show any unpleasant feelings on the outside, and I continue to be cheery with them, although I keep a state of mind not to trust anyone there. END
BEGIN NOW They pass me the blunt and I take a super long hit, and hold it super long and blow out. END
BEGIN NOW After it went around a few times we all spark a cigarette to increase our high. END
BEGIN NOW We just keep talking and talking. END
BEGIN NOW It seems like time has stopped. END
BEGIN NOW How long can people just sit here and talk? END
BEGIN NOW Its been hours, I think to myself (strangely enough I am still puffing on the same cigarette, but dont notice anything unusual about it). END
BEGIN NOW Then I drop my butt, and it falls under the chair Im sitting on. END
BEGIN NOW 'Ah Shit' I said and got out of my seat to get it. END
BEGIN NOW I look under the chair but I cant seem to find it. END
BEGIN NOW 'Did any of you see were my...' as I turn around I notice no one is there, and I am alone in the pen. END
BEGIN NOW A sense of anger comes over me, and I get intense feelings of 'I shouldnt have trusted them' and 'how dare they'. END
BEGIN NOW These feelings are followed by loneliness and then total fear. END
BEGIN NOW I need to get out of this pen and go back in the house. END
BEGIN NOW I walk back to my house across the long field, and it seems to take even longer to go back than when I had come. END
BEGIN NOW Next thing I know Im back in my kitchen lying on the floor very sweaty, Steve is there sitting on the kitchen counter. END
BEGIN NOW My focus is very blurred and 'off' and I feel very confused about why hes there on the counter and Im on the floor, but every few moments I kinda snap back into reality and know exactly what going on, then snap back into delirium and totally forget everything. END
BEGIN NOW Next thing I know its already 6:46am and I am running late. END
BEGIN NOW My mom tells me I only got a half hour to get ready or ill get a Saturday detention. END
BEGIN NOW I scramble out of bed and run into the bathroom to take a shower. END
BEGIN NOW I suddenly realize how mush schools gonna suck cause I forgot to do my homework and I have an oral presentation due today. END
BEGIN NOW All these thoughts make me panic and I know theres no way out of it cause I already skipped school 3 times this year and got caught and I cant skip another day or I have to go to court. END
BEGIN NOW I get out of the shower and dry off as quickly as I can. END
BEGIN NOW Then I run into my room and get dressed and go downstairs to the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW Right then I noticed something was wrong, the clock said 1:00am and the calendar was on July. END
BEGIN NOW No body was up. END
BEGIN NOW My mom was asleep and had been asleep. END
BEGIN NOW She didnt wake me up for school, I did not have school in summer. END
BEGIN NOW I wished I was dreaming, and the thoughts in my mind were on the brink of driving me insane. END
BEGIN NOW All I remember after this is running back up into my room in total panic ready to cry and scream and if one more weird thing happened I was gonna commit suicide. END
BEGIN NOW I woke up in my bed with Steve on the floor watching me, he looked very concerned and asked me if I was ok now, if I was still tripping. END
BEGIN NOW I didnt know what to say to him, cause right then I could have still be tripping for all I know. END
BEGIN NOW It was 5:00pm the next day, I had a bad headache and couldnt focus on shit, and my whole body was in this dreadfully uncomfortable state. END
BEGIN NOW It took me awhile to collect my thoughts and figure out I was not tripping anymore, and I had these series of very strange realistic dreams stuck in my head from when I was asleep, but I cant for the life of me remember what they were now, I forgot them completely about 4 hours after I woke up. END
BEGIN NOW From Steves point of view, in a nutshell, I had started acting weird when I had gotten the water from the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW He said that he was trying to talk to me but I would just have this blank stare like I couldnt see him, and then ran outside into my shed in the backyard and started talking to myself, and after an hour or so I ran out of the shed with this scared shitless look on my face and fell down, and crawled back into the house, into the bathroom and he said I was trying to drink out of the toilet, he pulled me up and carried me into the kitchen and put down on the floor and got some ice for me. END
BEGIN NOW He said I was talking in my sleep and saying random words in no logical order whatsoever but I was saying them fluently like I knew what I was talking about. END
BEGIN NOW Before my mom came home, he carried me upstairs and put me to bed, and stayed up to watch me, and he said I was talking out loud and moving around like I was having nightmares, and around midnight I sprang out of bed and ran into the bathroom and got in the shower for an hour and then went back into my room and put a shirt on backwards and some boxers but no pants and ran downstairs and stood in the kitchen for 10 minutes, just standing there. END
BEGIN NOW He said then I freaked out and ran upstairs into my room and he said he had to push me onto my bed and hold me down until I stopped moving, and eventually fell asleep, then he did. END
BEGIN NOW He woke up around 10 that day and I slept till 5. END
BEGIN NOW To sum it up in one word...insanity. END
BEGIN NOW Thats what if feels like if you start to snap out of it and realize whats happening, but then you just go back into this state of total confusion and its enough to drive anyone crazy. END
BEGIN NOW Overall I am glad I experienced this, just to know what its like, but this is not for everyone, and Im not saying the experience was at all pleasant, so I have no motivation to do it again anytime soon, maybe someday years from now just for some crazy fun. END
BEGIN NOW But this Datura seems to be something not of this world. END
BEGIN NOW The hallucinations were accompanied by delirium and confusion which made them seem real and like I wasnt really tripping. END
BEGIN NOW This stuff truly is THE DEVILS WEED. END
BEGIN NOW So... END
BEGIN NOW I decided to take Datura orally for the first time at Burning Man in 2006. END
BEGIN NOW A couple months earlier I had smoked the flowers for the first time with my mother, and she had sent me off to the desert with a Ziploc full of dried leaves and flowers. END
BEGIN NOW Smoking the flowers, as others have reported is a slightly less relaxing buzz than that of marijuana (though surprisingly similar). END
BEGIN NOW Given the choice, I think I'd always pick marijuana, because it tastes better and it's less edgy. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow, fast forward to Black Rock City, a few days into the burn. END
BEGIN NOW I'm there with my sister, 3 year old nephew and girlfriend of many years. END
BEGIN NOW We decide that I'll be the first to do this, and perhaps that they will try some the next night, depending on how it goes for me. END
BEGIN NOW I make sun tea out of the flowers, stems and leaves by stuffing a bunch of them into a waterbottle, and sitting it on top of the van until the sun goes down. END
BEGIN NOW I mix some up with a chai tea, and do my best to get it down. END
BEGIN NOW A pretty foul brew, and of course I make that choice I always recognize as foolish later - after my initial dose, and waiting for a short while, I feel nothing and decide to pour myself another dose. END
BEGIN NOW Almost immediately, the first dose kicks in. END
BEGIN NOW Considering the anti-emetic effects, I am lucky to vomit almost right away before it becomes impossible, kicking out some of that second dose before it piles on top of the first one. END
BEGIN NOW There's a process of being taken to the porta-potties and back to camp by my g/f. END
BEGIN NOW At this point, I'm having difficulty tracking the proper direction to and from these destinations, and an intense, horrid thirst. END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely the most parched I've ever felt in my life, and I don't have my water bottle with me during the trek. END
BEGIN NOW It's not pleasant in the least, and I'm squeezing my g/fs hand very hard, being mean and cranky and difficult to sit for, constantly pulling her off course and complaining loudly about how frustratingly thirsty I am as we make this little journey. END
BEGIN NOW Fortunately, this was probably the worst part of the whole experience, and things began to get better as soon as I managed to get back to camp and ingest some fluids. END
BEGIN NOW Nonetheless, things are coming on strong, with a lot of body buzz. END
BEGIN NOW After a small bit of exploring in camp, including apparently unsuccessful attempts to touch the pink flamingo attached to the van antenna, I decide that before I'm ready to deal with the world in this new state, I'm going to need to lie down in the van on the mattress and relax under the covers, and get used to my body. END
BEGIN NOW As I say to my companions, 'I feel like my feet are made out of something other than feet'. END
BEGIN NOW I spend some time in the dark, expecting the kalidescope fractals of other hallucinogens, but there's actually very little of this. END
BEGIN NOW I spend a bit of time reading (I think it was Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, but it may have been Inifinite Jest - I really can't remember at this point, except that it was one of my two large blue books, so it had to be one of them) and discover the visual distortion that will follow me through the evening. END
BEGIN NOW To wit, everything appears to be about six inches closer to me than it actually is (explaining my failure to make contact with the flamingo earlier that so amused my companions). END
BEGIN NOW I discover this because I'm unable to read my book with my glasses on, but if I take them off and hold the book at a normal distance, I'm able to read the book just as I would if I were holding it too close to my face with them off. END
BEGIN NOW Now, after a bit of accustoming myself to my new world, I get up out of bed and decide that it's time to play. END
BEGIN NOW My sister and g/f are not in camp when I climb out of the van and, reflecting on how unpleasant the trip to the bathroom with the g/f had been, decided to throw caution to the wind and left camp without a babysitter. END
BEGIN NOW When I eventually returned, I discovered that this had, of course, totally throw them for a loop, and that my g/f had a pretty good panic and went hunting for me, unsuccessfully. END
BEGIN NOW Once I set out on foot, I found that, while still present, the sensation of increased gravity began to lift away and my spirits rose. END
BEGIN NOW Other than the issue of depth perception, which made it seem to the people around me that I was trying to pet the things I was really trying to reach for, I didn't have the noticeable fluid visual hallucinations associate with many other hallucinogens. END
BEGIN NOW But, with the fact that I was at Burning Man of all places, and my lack of a babysitter to corroborate my story with, I frankly have no idea what I saw and heard that was real and what was purely a construct of my mind, making it hard to piece together a narrative of my experiences. END
BEGIN NOW I definitely experienced some disorientation, occasionally wandering into other peoples camps inappropriately. END
BEGIN NOW I was also subject to the phantom cigarettes and other items that so many other users report. END
BEGIN NOW In my case, I also had a phantom water bottle. END
BEGIN NOW I suspect that this phenomenon, while most commonly reported with the cigarettes, is actually something that is a user subjective occurence based on whatever repetetive actions they commonly perform. END
BEGIN NOW This would explain the water bottle for me (as keeping hydrated is the most common repetetive action I have going on out there on the Playa), and what I've heard for other people, like gamers who will fall into playing a game with a phantom controller. END
BEGIN NOW I had an extensive conversation with one fellow sitting under the scavenger hunt board, who I assumed was real, and a few other people encounters, but I do not recall imagining meetings with people I know, which seems to be something most people do run into. END
BEGIN NOW Instead, the most unusual effect is that I had what I can only call hallucinatory memories. END
BEGIN NOW I would find myself acting on a memory of something said or done, only to realize that not only had I not actually had the conversation or taken the action that triggered what I was doing, but that I hadn't even hallucinated the conversation or action, but that I was remembering something I had not experienced at all. END
BEGIN NOW Disconcerting, to say the least! END
BEGIN NOW One such scenario happened as I was trying to find my way back to our camp, and realized that I was bearing in the wrong direction, because I remembered distinctly having a discussion with someone about how a whole row of sites had been moved one row further out. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly I realized that there was no way that would have happened, and that the conversation hadn't actually happened, nor had I even experienced a hallucinatory conversation, and that I was remembering something completely false. END
BEGIN NOW I also spent quite some time searching for my bicycle, which I had distinct memories of leaving... somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW In a very dreamlike state, I would wander looking for it, lose track of my self, start doing something else and then remember that I needed to find my bike. END
BEGIN NOW Eventually I gave it up for lost, and I did make it back to camp and reassured everyone that I was still alive and OK. END
BEGIN NOW I had never had my bike with me, it was in camp the whole time. END
BEGIN NOW After a bit, I decided that I had had probably about enough of Datura world, so I took 25mg of Trazodone which put me to sleep and allowed me to sleep well into the heat of the next day. END
BEGIN NOW Normally, I hate using Trazodone as a sleep aid, as it tends to require a very long window in which to rest (12-16 hours), or I'm unable to function the next day, but in this case, that was just what I needed. END
BEGIN NOW The next day I was still mildly disassociated, but I didn't have the multiday ongoing trip that many users report. END
BEGIN NOW Again, I think I was probably pretty fortunate to vomit early on, or I expect I would have had an even longer stranger trip. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't taken an oral dosage of it since, but I found my experience to be pretty positive overall, and have definitely considered doing it again. END
BEGIN NOW The environment I was in was, I think, a big part of why it was so positive - I can see why taking this drug around a lot of straight folks in a real city, instead of the sea of freaks in a temporary city, might be overwhelming and much more difficult to maintain. END
BEGIN NOW Running off without my sitter was unwise, and a bit rude of me, but I don't think I would have enjoyed that particular individual sitting me for the trip, so it turned out to be a good thing. END
BEGIN NOW If I do it again, I think I'd really like to have a partner in the experience to compare with, as well as a sober sitter to keep an eye on us. END
BEGIN NOW Both my girlfriend and sister chose not to imbibe, but I believe I was able to pass some on to another burner, though I don't recall ever getting any feedback from him on how it went. END
BEGIN NOW What follows are the events of my first two experimental Datura trips. END
BEGIN NOW Im a 21 year old, 200 pound male experienced psychonaut, having used nearly all common psychedelics multiple times, as well as all but one 2C chemical. END
BEGIN NOW Im an uncanny hard head to most psychedelic compounds (much to my dismay) which means I can rarely achieve the level of experience as many other experience report authors, unless taking an immensely high dose. END
BEGIN NOW The Datura inoxia I used was found on my college campus, and it is definitely a genuine, native specimen. END
BEGIN NOW I have spent much of this year researching and reading on the tropane alkaloid containing plants (Datura, belladonna, mandrake, brugmansia, and henbane to name a few). END
BEGIN NOW I had my heart set on belladonna, but recently I discovered a perfectly good Datura shrub, and that gave me the inspiration to begin. END
BEGIN NOW Both of these experiments were done indoors, in a large house with 21 members. END
BEGIN NOW They were all good friends, and a few of them knew what I was planning to do. END
BEGIN NOW I chose two experienced trip sitters to read a handful of Datura trip reports and the Datura-sitting guidelines, just in case things went sour. END
BEGIN NOW Experiment one: 

T-0:00 (3:00pm): Ground up 50 small Datura inoxia seeds in a mortar and pestle. END
BEGIN NOW The seed coats are exceedingly durable, and the mortar and pestle did very little to truly crush them. END
BEGIN NOW Moisture was expelled from them only after a long period of crushing. END
BEGIN NOW I chewed them as much as I could, and washed them down with water. END
BEGIN NOW Despite intense bitterness, I was able to choke them down with minimal gagging. END
BEGIN NOW This is a test run for me; I find it highly unlikely that the small dose will affect me. END
BEGIN NOW Fortunately, you can always take more after the fact, but you can never take less. END
BEGIN NOW At 200 pounds, this may be one of the smallest dose to weight ratios for which there is a plausible experience report. END
BEGIN NOW T+0:50: Ive begun to feel the gradual placebo come up; something I often feel when very anxious about a new drug. END
BEGIN NOW Its nearly certainly psychological, but to enhance the feeling, I smoked 10 seeds of Datura Inoxia out of a waterless bong. END
BEGIN NOW They smoke surprisingly well, and the taste, although slightly acrid, isnt entirely unpleasant. END
BEGIN NOW Its difficult to inhale once a certain smoke volume is reached, and the seeds taste much like a cross between burning marshmallow and gasoline. END
BEGIN NOW Taking large bong rips is completely out of the question due to the power of the smoke. END
BEGIN NOW The smoking has elicited a rather dry mouth, as expected, but only slight changes in perception. END
BEGIN NOW T+1:00: Another 10 seeds were smoked, this time with water added to the bong. END
BEGIN NOW This markedly increased the volume able to be inhaled. END
BEGIN NOW Sensory effects have begun to grow, but only slightly. END
BEGIN NOW T+2:00: Ive been trying to sleep for the last hour and surprisingly it was a comfortable nap. END
BEGIN NOW However, the effects were very faint. END
BEGIN NOW I had difficulty focusing on things, much like trying to view something after staring at the sun for a while. END
BEGIN NOW But the one way I knew that it was working was the dry mouth and throat; it was completely impossible to rehydrate; water simply seemed to run off the dry lining of my throat rather than absorbing into it. END
BEGIN NOW T+4:00 no new effects have cropped up, aside from more noticeable dry throat and an increase in epidermal discomfort; I felt as though I was wearing a wool jumpsuit with nothing over it. END
BEGIN NOW My friend and I cooked a delicious pizza, but I found it to be tasteless and dry due to the supreme lack of saliva in my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW It filled me up, but didnt grant me even the slightest pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW T+6:00: I feel to be coming down already which is uncommon according to most Datura trip reports. END
BEGIN NOW The sore throat has gotten markedly better, my vision is slightly off kilter but barely noticeably so, and the skin irritation is no longer present. END
BEGIN NOW Ill probably call it a night early, and for the next experiment, either double the seed dose and/or smoke the leaves and roots. END
BEGIN NOW A tea may also help. END
BEGIN NOW T+14:00: Feel much better this morning, although it has reminded me of how unpleasant the earlier night had been. END
BEGIN NOW Im certainly not looking forward to upping the dosage... END
BEGIN NOW Experience 2: 

T-0:00: I chose to up the dosage considerably on my second experiment with Datura, picking one fresh flower, four fresh leaves, and roughly 300 seeds. END
BEGIN NOW I pulverized them all in a mortar and pestle until there was a soggy wad. END
BEGIN NOW This wad was added to 1.5 cups of boiling water, and I allowed fifteen minutes to elapse for the solution to concentrate and release the tropane alkaloids. END
BEGIN NOW One cup of the water evaporated in the boiling process, leaving 12 cup. END
BEGIN NOW I strained this with a coffee filter into another cup filled with lemonade and fruit punch. END
BEGIN NOW In this mixture, the Datura wasnt even noticeable. END
BEGIN NOW T+1:00: The dry mouth is already in full swing, and by body does not feel good at all. END
BEGIN NOW There are pins and needles all over me, and no amount of rubbing helps. END
BEGIN NOW I have also grown extremely unbalanced, almost exactly how I feel while intoxicated with alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW I generally am holding on to something as I wander around my house, to keep from tripping (physically). END
BEGIN NOW T+2:00: Ive fallen into some sort of hypnotic hibernation. END
BEGIN NOW I feel too lousy to walk around, my eyes hurt too much to open, and the spring water I drink is indistinguishable from puddle water. END
BEGIN NOW So I sit on my love sack, eyes closed, body intensely irritated. END
BEGIN NOW At one point, needing to go to the bathroom, I got up and swayed my way to the toilet. END
BEGIN NOW In my experience, walking while on Datura is much like walking blindfolded in a boulder field. END
BEGIN NOW Its impossible to tell when my feet are going to land on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Occasionally it felt as though I was walking with one foot on the sidewalk and one on the road. END
BEGIN NOW Urination is highly abnormal: I pee for much longer than average, but the volume expelled is significantly smaller. END
BEGIN NOW Also, after finishing, I feel like I need to go even worse than before. END
BEGIN NOW T+3:00: I believe I finally got into bed at this point, and that is where the trip truly started. END
BEGIN NOW Its very difficult to explain, but I began to have the ability to switch between reality and dreams. END
BEGIN NOW One minute, in my minds eye, Id be sitting in a field, speaking to a friend or two (in my head, not out loud). END
BEGIN NOW Id jerk my eyes open and return swiftly to lying in bed. END
BEGIN NOW But the second my eyes closed again, there I was in an entirely new setting. END
BEGIN NOW The most incredible thing about these dream hallucinations was the speed with which they unraveled. END
BEGIN NOW I was literally having about six small dreams a minute, ranging from a quick brusque conversation to weeding a garden. END
BEGIN NOW Despite how mundane they were, it was always very peculiar to choose when to awake. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldnt call these lucid dreams, because I was not in control of what I was dreaming; I could only manipulate the point when I started and when I ended the dream. END
BEGIN NOW Very few times, during what I assume were slightly more realistic dreams, I even woke myself up by speaking out loud rather than in my head. END
BEGIN NOW (Ive never talked or walked in my sleep.) END
BEGIN NOW T+5:00: Im woken up by some friends (they were not imaginary this time,) and we went downstairs to play some poker and then participate in a fraternity initiation ritual. END
BEGIN NOW The game had already started, and I was told to pick out my chips to buy in. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I counted out my chips and sat down at the table. END
BEGIN NOW Did you get your chips, F? END
BEGIN NOW I hear. END
BEGIN NOW Looking down, I see that there were no chips there. END
BEGIN NOW Embarrassed, I got up and counted out the chips again. END
BEGIN NOW I played five or so hands, but had a very difficult time reading the cards, and often made poor bets because I saw a four of hearts when it was really a five of diamonds. END
BEGIN NOW The ritual began, and I spent most of the time with my head down, testing the dreamlands once again. END
BEGIN NOW I took to having the same dream over and over again, in which I pick up a golden hexagonal prism. END
BEGIN NOW Each time, I tried to awaken still holding the box, but of course my fist was always tightly clenched around nothing. END
BEGIN NOW T+7:00: The ritual ends, and Ive finally managed to get to bed. END
BEGIN NOW The dreams are growing longer and more difficult to awaken from, and I think the effects are starting to wear off. END
BEGIN NOW T+9:00: I wake up again to lead another ritual, but Im so delirious at this point that Im unable to speak much and (for all I know) really frightening the pledges. END
BEGIN NOW Mercifully the ritual does not take much time at all, and Im able to return to bed. END
BEGIN NOW Although the sleep is fitful, I manage to fall into normal rest. END
BEGIN NOW T+15:00: The major effects are long gone, but I still feel slightly irritated. END
BEGIN NOW I have quite severe nearsightedness under normal circumstances, hovering around 20/100 in both eyes. END
BEGIN NOW However, at this point, the condition seems to have reversed. END
BEGIN NOW While normally I read with the book 8 inches away from my eyes, I cannot even begin to make out the letters with less that 12 inches distance between the page and my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW T+18:00: The rest of the day has turned out to get significantly better, although my short term memory is utterly destroyed. END
BEGIN NOW Ive been starting conversations, and in seconds, completely losing track of what we were talking about. END
BEGIN NOW Ive even lost the will to try and remember what the topic is. END
BEGIN NOW Im sure things will return to baseline by tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW Conclusion: This experience was much more like the average Datura report, in that it included a thin line between reality and surreality. END
BEGIN NOW I dont think I reached the level Im trying for yet, but this dose is very close. END
BEGIN NOW I believe I have one more attempt left in me before I leave Datura alone and move on to something with less of a body load and unpleasant side effects. END
BEGIN NOW However, I wish to give a good long time to prepare even more. END
BEGIN NOW Afterthought: I absolutely love altering my conscious, no matter how (Drugs, pain, meditation, or even things like removing my sight for a day). END
BEGIN NOW However, this drug is certainly not something I would seek out if I were looking for a good time. END
BEGIN NOW Although I wouldnt call this a negative or a positive experience, I believe that an overwhelming majority of people should avoid it. END
BEGIN NOW Just because it grows like a weed doesnt mean you should treat it like one. END
BEGIN NOW Some people say that each plant has a spirit associated with it. END
BEGIN NOW If marijuanas spirit is a laid-back, spacey woman, Daturas is a cunning and tricky sorceress. END
BEGIN NOW Even after years of Salvia experience, I believe Datura is fathoms more powerful, simply due to how permanently it can rip you from reality. END
BEGIN NOW I was with a few friends one night when I saw a plant with small cactus pods. END
BEGIN NOW I remembered having heard about it before when I was a few years younger. END
BEGIN NOW They were called Jimson weed. END
BEGIN NOW The word around the campfire was that if you cut open the pod and let the seeds dry out, they will turn brown and be edible. END
BEGIN NOW I had never heard anything about dosage, although, I seem to recall hearing something about eating no more than half a pod, though I am unsure if that was when I first discovered Datura or after my friends took it at my first encounter with it. END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, I took a few pods off the plant and decided to share them with other psychonauts I knew. END
BEGIN NOW I could not find the few people I knew would have tried it so I dried out a couple pods, anyway. END
BEGIN NOW A couple days later I saw that the seeds had turned gustably brown. END
BEGIN NOW At about 7:00P.M. END
BEGIN NOW I swallowed about half a pod which I estimated to contain about 280-320 seeds. END
BEGIN NOW I guess about two hours had passed until I started to feel the effects. END
BEGIN NOW I had no idea what to expect. END
BEGIN NOW I was watching something on TV with the lights off. END
BEGIN NOW I started to feel dissappointed. END
BEGIN NOW I got up to get a drink, or something, and I felt very heavy and lost my balance when I stood up. END
BEGIN NOW I remember telling myself 'wow, I am flying! END
BEGIN NOW I am really flying! END
BEGIN NOW '(the enthusiasm about flying came from my previous notions about powerful drugs like that: they will make you feel like you can fly). END
BEGIN NOW At that pseudoaerial moment the feelings were pleasant and euphoric until a vicious feeling of a cotton-mouth hit me. END
BEGIN NOW I 'glided' to the sink and got a drink. END
BEGIN NOW A few seconds later I had the same cotton mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I had terrible balance and poor depth perception(greatly reduced ability to know how far away anything was from my grasp). END
BEGIN NOW My friend Chris came home and didn't seem to notice anything was awry. END
BEGIN NOW Then my mum came home. END
BEGIN NOW it must have been near 8:00-30 now. END
BEGIN NOW It was November at the time and quite cold in Woodstock, Canada. END
BEGIN NOW I had been seeing some fast, black dots streaking across the room like a fly buzzing around. END
BEGIN NOW I remarked to my mum and Chris that I thought it 'amazing that flies are still buzzing around this late into November. END
BEGIN NOW I thought they all would have frozen.' END
BEGIN NOW They had no idea what I was talking about. END
BEGIN NOW The next thing I remember after my 'flies in November' observation was putting somebody's boot on the countertop and inserting various items like a pencil, a salt shaker, crackers, a fork, a small booklet and other small objects, into the boot. END
BEGIN NOW I can only remember telling my mum and Chris that I had some purpose to my actions; that it was a vital task I had to undertake. END
BEGIN NOW After I put all the random objects into the boot I put it back on the shoe mat, carefully and methodically. END
BEGIN NOW After that I stumbled to the fridge and became frustrated after attempting to grab a hold of the fridge handle. END
BEGIN NOW I could not sense how far away the handle was. END
BEGIN NOW I finally got it, flustered and nearly exhausted from so many failed attempts to open it. END
BEGIN NOW I just stared listlessly into the fridge and grabbed a carton of soy milk. END
BEGIN NOW I looked at it, astonished at what I was holding. END
BEGIN NOW With my eyes wide open and mouth ajar as if I had just prevented a lit cigarette in my dust bin from igniting some tissues and newspapers on fire, I asked Chris, 'wow, Chris! END
BEGIN NOW Where did I get this?' END
BEGIN NOW 'Uhhh, the fridge,' he said. END
BEGIN NOW At this point they still didn't grasp the seriousness of just how stoned I was. END
BEGIN NOW They were aware that I was acting strangely, but couldn't think of anything that would have had that effect on me. END
BEGIN NOW My mum was a bit worried and deduced that I must have taken something, and told Chris to keep an eye on me. END
BEGIN NOW It must have been around 9:30-10:00, about two or three hours into the ordeal, when I found myself in the bathroom, several times, as I kept walking in and out after completing some job. END
BEGIN NOW I remember holding an oval soap dish with a brown and golden ancient Egyptian border around it. END
BEGIN NOW I kept trying to wash it off and then I would place it on its side when I finished. END
BEGIN NOW Chris was standing at the bathroom door the whole time without my noticing him, just watching what I was doing the way someone would watch a physical altercation unfolding across a parking lot, waiting to see if it would become serious or violent before getting involved. END
BEGIN NOW Every once in a while I would realise he was there and tell him that things needed to be cleaned and that there was some problem in the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW The most severe (if that is the right word) thing I remember from that night was waliking into the bathroom again. END
BEGIN NOW I looked at the mirror and noticed I had a small, white stain on my Jimi Hendrix t-shirt. END
BEGIN NOW I tried to rub it off and remarked to the stranger in the mirror that we had the same stain. END
BEGIN NOW Just seconds later I pointed out that we also had the same shirt. END
BEGIN NOW I became quite irritated and defensive about this imposter in my bathroom and bitterly said to him 'get the fuck out of my house! END
BEGIN NOW What are doin' in my house? END
BEGIN NOW Dude, you need to get the fuck out, now!' END
BEGIN NOW Chris just watched in shock. END
BEGIN NOW Who could ever have imagined it possible for a person to forget his own reflection? END
BEGIN NOW and then become enraged at it, too? END
BEGIN NOW He calmed me down and assured me that I was overreacting. END
BEGIN NOW I have no memory of what I did immediately after that. END
BEGIN NOW I think I blacked out, but I was still walking around. END
BEGIN NOW My memory seemed to have shut off. END
BEGIN NOW The next thing I remember, quite suddenly, as if my memory had been turned on again, was standing in the bathroom looking at my mum as she extracted a body towel, a hand towel and a face cloth from the toilet. END
BEGIN NOW I had no idea what was going on. END
BEGIN NOW She looked really worried about me. END
BEGIN NOW She kept asking Chris what I took but he didn't know either and they couldn't get any sensible answer from me. END
BEGIN NOW I have a very vague memory of having some complex purpose for putting the towels in the toilet. END
BEGIN NOW During all this, by the way, I had still had the savage dry mouth, so I had been drinking water periodically. END
BEGIN NOW At around 12:30 A.M., five and a half hours after I had ingested the seeds, I had still been plagued by the abrasive cotton-mouth, and by a painfully full bladder because of all the water I had drunk to quench it. END
BEGIN NOW I had not been able to urinate at all during the peak effects or during any of my adventures in the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW All the water had added up and hurt my bladder immensely. END
BEGIN NOW I could not manage even a small drop of urine despite the obvious need to do so. END
BEGIN NOW I am not sure how much time passed after the incident with the towels, but my best guess is about 1.5-two hours. END
BEGIN NOW During the night's final stages my sense of identity returned along with my motor coordination, but I began to have unpleasantly vivid, tactile hallucinations of translucent spiders with long, curly tails composed of what seemed like fishing line. END
BEGIN NOW They had made me very agitated and paranoid because they had been crawling up the walls, on the floor around me, up my legs, in my hair and up the curtains. END
BEGIN NOW There were not swarms of them, as you might have inferred, but roughly a dozen or more visible at any moment. END
BEGIN NOW I became quite distressed about the situation because they felt very real. END
BEGIN NOW Wherever I looked I could see that their long, cumbersome tails had been making them very clumsy as they crawled. END
BEGIN NOW The hallucinations were so overwhelmingly vivid and tactile because whenever I stepped on their 'tails' they illusively tripped up, or got snagged beneath my feet and struggled to go anywhere, whether along the floor, or up the walls. END
BEGIN NOW The sensations were so tactile that I felt itchy as they stumbled up my arms and legs. END
BEGIN NOW I was not scared or overly distraught, or anywhere near panicking, as one would assume, but paranoid and overwrought. END
BEGIN NOW I compulsively scanned the room for them and tried to see where they had all come from. END
BEGIN NOW They had been combing the room like white smoke, everywhere I looked. END
BEGIN NOW My mood changed from being tensely agitated to immensely irritated by them. END
BEGIN NOW After repeated attempts from anxiety to squash them with my feet, my vengeful efforts to rid my home of these clumsy, hybrid creatures led me to summon my dog Lucy for help. END
BEGIN NOW I commanded her to 'get 'em!' END
BEGIN NOW and pointed to them, floundering and limping beneath her snout. END
BEGIN NOW She just wagged her tail as she sniffed the floor, frantically trying to get what I was pointing at and then promotly returned to her original position to listen to whatever I said. END
BEGIN NOW The next day, Chris told me I had been talking to Lucy seriously, as if she were conversing with me and satisfying my curiosity about whatever topic. END
BEGIN NOW She followed me everywhere I went, always at my heels or sat attentively in front of me. END
BEGIN NOW There was one point during my experience, despite the distressing hallucinations that absorbed me, when I realised with a small degree of deliberate cognizance, Lucy's bizarre (who's calling who bizarre?) END
BEGIN NOW behaviour and sensed that she knew something was wrong with me. END
BEGIN NOW She had a concerned, penetrating look in her eyes every time I had stopped wandering. END
BEGIN NOW Once again the agonising urge to urinate brought me back to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW I could still see the spiders climbing everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW I must have stood at the toilet with my pants down for twenty minutes, or more, while I tried to pee. END
BEGIN NOW I was too distracted by all the spiders struggling to climb up the toilet bowl. END
BEGIN NOW I flushed the toilet and they all managed to stay on the surface of the water. END
BEGIN NOW Eventually I started to pee,painfully and only a little at first. END
BEGIN NOW It definitely wasn't a situation I would want anybody seeing. END
BEGIN NOW I think the determination to drown the spiders in piss made myself able to finally pee. END
BEGIN NOW I had such a long, orgasmic emiction, perhaps the longest I have ever had. END
BEGIN NOW After that I went to bed, brought Lucy up, and had a conversation with her about work. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know how long I had been conversing with her when I suddenly came to my senses and said to myself, 'what the fuck is wrong with me? END
BEGIN NOW I was just talking to my dog,' and laughed. END
BEGIN NOW I was very glad when that was over. END
BEGIN NOW Would I do it again? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, now that I know what to expect. END
BEGIN NOW Next time I will have ice cubes at my disposal to relieve the dry mouth, this way I won't have to drink copiously. END
BEGIN NOW The Entree: 

25 finely chewed seeds of Datura Stramonium, aged to racemize the hyoscyamine to atropine and the scopolamine to atroscine. END
BEGIN NOW Each seed is roughly 7-8 mgs, but alkaloid content of each seed varies too much to be consistent. END
BEGIN NOW 2 bowls of Blueberry Kush, cured to decarboxylate the THCA, and smoked approximately two hours after ingestion of the Datura. END
BEGIN NOW I eye the small cluster of black, teardrop-shaped seeds in the palm of my hand with a mix of apprehension and usual pre-trip anxiety. END
BEGIN NOW They taste bitter with a hint of an earthy bite; not bad by any means but the hard husks get stuck in my teeth. END
BEGIN NOW I chew well and let the mass sit in my mouth for a few minutes to aid any sublingual absorption, and prepare to joyously delve into the bowels of torment and despair. END
BEGIN NOW The Trip: 

Eyes closed, pitch blackness. END
BEGIN NOW A sense of evil, a seductively malevolent vibe. END
BEGIN NOW Apprehension as the gears of my perspective slowly creak into the lower planes. END
BEGIN NOW Streaking spirals of light, growing brighter and brighter until... suddenly, break through. END
BEGIN NOW People and landscapes in perfect clarity as if I were watching through an invisible camera. END
BEGIN NOW A man turns towards his wife before stabbing her violently in the back. END
BEGIN NOW He rips the peeling flesh from her body as insects suddenly pour out. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW A pool of blood, undulating with red waves. END
BEGIN NOW Body parts falling in, silently splashing. END
BEGIN NOW No sound whatsoever to these visions. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW A wolf, black eyes, digging into an unidentifiable corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Strings of meat are dangling between its teeth. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW Many scenes of erotica, usually ending in gory climax. END
BEGIN NOW My skull is but a padded cell, the walls of which my inner demons bounce off. END
BEGIN NOW Themes of sadomasochism, violence punctuated by guilty pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW I hear sounds of sheer chaos. END
BEGIN NOW Screams, thumps. END
BEGIN NOW Dragging noises. END
BEGIN NOW Someone calling my name, louder, and louder. END
BEGIN NOW A gentle hiss and a bump. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW Spiders. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of spiders, pouring through the cracks of reality as if puncturing through this thin veil of ordinary life. END
BEGIN NOW I feel things gently running over my body. END
BEGIN NOW I don't open my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW Swinging bodies on nooses, burning. END
BEGIN NOW Fire, blood dripping as maggots squirm into the quivering flesh. END
BEGIN NOW I am carrying on a conversation with something, but I do not know what. END
BEGIN NOW My mind echoes with distorted fragments of meaning; snippets of grand truth ripped from this primeval chaos. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of blood. END
BEGIN NOW Death. END
BEGIN NOW Churning corpses being flayed. END
BEGIN NOW Rotating scenes of razor-sharp blades dissecting through my mind. END
BEGIN NOW I contemplate the nature of fear in all its manifestations--here there is true, unmitigated terror. END
BEGIN NOW A woman reaches back and rips the top part of her skull off; a horde of black moths flies out. END
BEGIN NOW I hear the whispering voices of angels. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW I lift my eyelids and stare into the darkness of my room to find relief from the torrential deluge of demonic imagery. END
BEGIN NOW My wall is covered with crawling black things. END
BEGIN NOW Posters and my pull up bar, dimly seen in the nonexistent light, are bending at absurd angles and then popping back to their rightful shape. END
BEGIN NOW Swarms of gnats have infested my room, making the darkness heavier with their presence. END
BEGIN NOW The wall shudders as its cracks begin to disgorge countless more denizens of the shadows. END
BEGIN NOW I have welcomed in the eldritch beasties of the night, and I'm here to pay them homage. END
BEGIN NOW I close my eyes again, and sink further into the welcome depths of Hell itself. END
BEGIN NOW The Aftermath: 

From the intense effects that I was experiencing (including open-eyed visuals, auditory hallucinations, and a quite intense mental trip), I expected that I had ingested too much of the tropane alkaloids and that I would undergo the typical three-day delirium that comes with an overdose. END
BEGIN NOW However, I woke up the next morning feeling nothing but refreshed and revived with fresh exhilaration. END
BEGIN NOW There was also no anticholinergic loss of cognitive faculties during the experience, which I usually feel under high doses of diphenhydramine and the like. END
BEGIN NOW My best guess is that marijuana synergizes wonderfully with the Datura plant (in India the combination of smoking Datura Metel with Cannabis is supposed to unify Shiva, the male spirit, with Shakti, the female spirit), and that this combination allowed me to experience a form of divinatory visions and open-eyed deliria without being overly toxic or long-lasting. END
BEGIN NOW I would not recommend this combination to anyone without first starting at low doses of 1 or 2 seeds and working your way up gradually with much time in between the doses. END
BEGIN NOW Datura is known to stress the cardiovascular system, and the combination with marijuana can put a great toll on the heart. END
BEGIN NOW Combine carefully and with low amounts. END
BEGIN NOW Silent meditation in the dark is good for best results, but I've also been able to use Stramonium before sleep for lucid dreaming purposes. END
BEGIN NOW Typically the trips manifest with an air of seductive evil, bloodshed, and death to them--things that I greatly enjoy as an alternative to the cliched puppies and flowers atmosphere of most traditional psychedelics. END
BEGIN NOW Tread the tropane waters carefully. END
BEGIN NOW Here there be demons. END
BEGIN NOW We walked inside, and sure enough there's a party going on. END
BEGIN NOW We see about 20 or so of our friends drinking, laughing, being loud. END
BEGIN NOW There were also strangers. END
BEGIN NOW Drew excused himself and went into his room, as he felt bad about the cat still. END
BEGIN NOW I was talking with some friends, and I noticed my friend Preston who was there, was crying blood. END
BEGIN NOW It looked like eye-shadow, a blood circle around his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW It was horrifically bizarre, and he looked like he was in pain. END
BEGIN NOW 'Are you okay?' END
BEGIN NOW I asked, and he just stared at me with an almost evil gaze, blood dripping from his face to the floor. END
BEGIN NOW I saw grotesque people I didn't recognize, who looked like sloth from the Goonies, but not in a comical way at all. END
BEGIN NOW They looked deformed, bruised, beaten, and burned, as they shuffled around the house. END
BEGIN NOW Some were laughing maniacally, some crying, others just staring. END
BEGIN NOW It was unsettling to say the least. END
BEGIN NOW Things were also 'painted' on, it's like a dream, and the 3-d world is irrelevant. END
BEGIN NOW There were burnt cigarettes and tacks sticking sharp side up on the ground, and bizarre looking plants 'pasted' to the walls and doors. END
BEGIN NOW I then saw people with beet-red skin, crying blood. END
BEGIN NOW They looked like what you would expect demons to look like, just like every fairly tale or myth or religious text makes them out to be (minus perhaps, wings). END
BEGIN NOW None of this seemed particularly odd to me at the time, I was confused who they were, but wasn't gripped with fear like I probably would have been was I sober. END
BEGIN NOW Some of these entities were having passionate, crazy sex in the back room, but they didn't look as if were they actually enjoying themselves. END
BEGIN NOW I kept hearing the sound of doors slamming. END
BEGIN NOW Drew came down to see what I was up to, and our friend Preston started talking to the both of us. END
BEGIN NOW 'You guys are late, we were waiting for you,' he said. END
BEGIN NOW 'We didn't know this was going on' said Drew. END
BEGIN NOW 'Where's Kyle?' END
BEGIN NOW I asked. END
BEGIN NOW (Kyle is Drews brother.) END
BEGIN NOW 'I haven't seen him yet,' Preston replied. END
BEGIN NOW We talked, just the three of us for a couple minutes, and then Drew excused himself to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't pee the entire time either, and our throats were probably the driest they had ever been. END
BEGIN NOW It hurt to swallow. END
BEGIN NOW Then I met the 'spirit' of the plant, Queen Toloache, as she is known indigenously and shamnically. END
BEGIN NOW She was pale, (not just albino pale, but literally skin tone like the moon) and imperious. END
BEGIN NOW She is also fond of tricks. END
BEGIN NOW I talked to her for a bit, though I will not share the conservation, as I feel by doing so is disrespectful. END
BEGIN NOW I sat on the floor, still noticing the tacks, which shimmered in my peripheral. END
BEGIN NOW My friend Chloe walked in through the kitchen, looking frail, beaten, and toothless. END
BEGIN NOW She explained that a group of Mexicans had just beaten and gangraped her. END
BEGIN NOW I looked over at a towel in a clear cylinder on the table, only I didn't see the towel, I saw a talking head, and this head was Chloe's. END
BEGIN NOW She was crying hysterically, and Toloache told me to give her a hug, which I did. END
BEGIN NOW I was literally hugging a beach towel in plastic. END
BEGIN NOW 'Oh my God, Sam, what the fuck!?' END
BEGIN NOW she gut-wrenchingly yelped, and then started crying. END
BEGIN NOW At this point, I honestly didn't know what to do, but my bladder felt like it was going to explode, so I said I'd be back and went downstairs to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW Drew's Mom was playing solitare on the computer and said hello to me. END
BEGIN NOW I waved, and went into the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW Chloe was sitting in the corner of the ceiling laughing scarily. END
BEGIN NOW When I walked to the toilet, Chloe was standing in my way. END
BEGIN NOW 'Chloe, can you please move, I have to pee like a racehorse.' END
BEGIN NOW She just stared for a second, and laughed. END
BEGIN NOW 'Chloe, if you don't move, I'm going to pee on you.' END
BEGIN NOW She just laughed again, louder. END
BEGIN NOW So that's what I tried to do. END
BEGIN NOW Again, almost nothing came out, but I did feel better. END
BEGIN NOW I went back upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW My Dad was there randomly, he opened the front door and said 'C'mon kid, let's went!' END
BEGIN NOW I wasn't expecting to see him there at all. END
BEGIN NOW 'I'll meet you in the car!' END
BEGIN NOW '...All right...' I thought, and went outside. END
BEGIN NOW He was no where to be found. END
BEGIN NOW I did see my friend Tom though, in an orange car parked right outside. END
BEGIN NOW He beckoned me to get in. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't, the door was locked. END
BEGIN NOW He kept waving me inside. END
BEGIN NOW 'I can't,' I said. END
BEGIN NOW Then Tom started laughing, and this actually irritated me. END
BEGIN NOW 'Forget it!' END
BEGIN NOW I shouted at him. END
BEGIN NOW I was confused where my Dad went, so I sat by myself on the curb. END
BEGIN NOW The house across the street has a wood stove top chimney on the roof, but I saw someone committing suicide by hanging himself instead. END
BEGIN NOW It was like an animated GIF, when my eyes moved at all, it would reset. END
BEGIN NOW When they stayed focused, the man walked off the roof with a noose and hung there, waving in the breeze. END
BEGIN NOW I should have mentioned this earlier, but all straight lines shook, like an episode of Dr. Katz. END
BEGIN NOW Everything flickered actually, like I was witnessing the erosion of time. END
BEGIN NOW I had seen that kind of thing before while on strong acid. END
BEGIN NOW (Just the lines, not anything else.) END
BEGIN NOW I look next to me (I'm still on the curb) and my friend Mike is by my side. END
BEGIN NOW 'What's your problem, man?' END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW 'I don't honestly know dude,' I said 'I took this plant earlier and now I can't tell exactly what's going on.' END
BEGIN NOW He looked at me quizzically. END
BEGIN NOW 'That's fine and all, and that would be a good excuse, if you weren't being such an asshole right now.' END
BEGIN NOW I felt like I was an asshole, ruining everyone's time, and I didn't know why. END
BEGIN NOW I glanced in Drew's Montero, and saw possibly the scariest thing out of this whole experience. END
BEGIN NOW There was a pale creature with no eyelids, with the most piercing stare I have ever seen in my entire life, sitting in the front passenger seat. END
BEGIN NOW His head was shaped almost like a sharks, pointing at the top, and he had no lips, and sharp, shark-like teeth. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, it looked exactly like the Hellraiser character 'Butterball,' minus the sunglasses, and paler. END
BEGIN NOW Just like in the movie, he said nothing. END
BEGIN NOW I had seen Hellraiser once before, when I was like 12, and remembered near to nothing from it. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't until I saw that movie again that I made the connection. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, I'm fairly confident Clive Barker has taken Datura before, after going through this experience. END
BEGIN NOW And the fact he wore sunglasses in the movie, and in 'reality' (call it what you will) had no eyelids at all, seems more than a coincidence to me. END
BEGIN NOW This powerful entity was the only one I could not look at straight in the face. END
BEGIN NOW I tried avoiding his gaze the entire time. END
BEGIN NOW I looked at a tree in the front yard. END
BEGIN NOW I could see a ghostly essence in the tree itself. END
BEGIN NOW Actually, I could see the 'essence' of all plant life. END
BEGIN NOW Chloe was right by that tree, falling over. END
BEGIN NOW I rushed to go help her, but she was 'painted' on a tall piece of dead grass, blowing flimsily in the wind. END
BEGIN NOW I needed to pee again. END
BEGIN NOW I went inside through the garage and somehow Chloe had beaten me there, and was crying on a coat rack. END
BEGIN NOW 'I don't want to live anymore!' END
BEGIN NOW she cried, and it was apparent to me that she was hanging herself. END
BEGIN NOW 'Chloe, no' I said sorrowfully, and reached to bring her down. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't Chloe, it was just a coat. END
BEGIN NOW I put the coat back and entered the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW Kyle was there. END
BEGIN NOW 'Yo Samwise, how's it going?' END
BEGIN NOW I actually thought about that question and laughed. END
BEGIN NOW 'I don't know, how are you doing Drew?' END
BEGIN NOW I asked a piece of paper which I thought was Drew, blowing from the fan. END
BEGIN NOW Kyle looked at me like I was the biggest dumbass in the world, and I don't blame him one bit. END
BEGIN NOW I went to the upstairs bathroom, and the light didn't work, and the darkness seemed to make the visions stronger. END
BEGIN NOW The toilet seat was swirling, and it was fairly hypnotizing. END
BEGIN NOW I also saw what looked like a ghost or shadow creature on the floor next to the toilet, outlined by a translucent silver. END
BEGIN NOW He was completely 2-dimensional, and appeared to be asking for my help, though I couldn't actually hear anything he was saying. END
BEGIN NOW I finally peed (at least more than I had yet) and felt immensely better, though I felt sorry for the shadow creature. END
BEGIN NOW It was kind of a dusty bathroom, and there were glowing insects attracted to the dust. END
BEGIN NOW They looked like ants, mini spiders, and other insects which probably don't exist, and they looked bioluminescent. END
BEGIN NOW I put my finger on the ground, and let one crawl onto my finger. END
BEGIN NOW I examined it more closely, and it's movements were that exactly like a bugs would be. END
BEGIN NOW It had feelers, and was 'feeling' me. END
BEGIN NOW I clamped my fingers together lightly and the insect crumbled like dust, it's legs floating spirally to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW I went back downstairs, and Toloache, still on the couch asked 'Did you see the life upstairs?' END
BEGIN NOW I nodded. END
BEGIN NOW I looked around, demons and deformed burn victims were still walking around nonchalantly. END
BEGIN NOW I went upstairs into Drew's room, to see how he was doing. END
BEGIN NOW He was watching TV with Mike. END
BEGIN NOW Then we noticed the neighbors yard via the window. END
BEGIN NOW It too, was bizarre. END
BEGIN NOW There was a four legged dog-creature (very large, and very black, with glowing red eyes) sitting on what looked like a throne, on the side of a swimming pool. END
BEGIN NOW There were many people basically having a blood orgy, and massive amounts of steam were rising from the water. END
BEGIN NOW There were also dead squirrels which littered the ground, and all throughout the branches of a large tree, were squirrel tails, hanging like evil Christmas ornaments. END
BEGIN NOW The Dog (whom I later found out is the second spirit associated with Datura, or second half, depending on perspective. END
BEGIN NOW He is known sometimes as 'The Guardian', or 'Protector', and protects Toloache) noticed us and beckoned us to come join them beyond the fence. END
BEGIN NOW Drew grabbed his binoculars and scoped out the scene. END
BEGIN NOW People were still having insatiable sex through a bunch of mist. END
BEGIN NOW However, with the binoculars we saw everything in grave detail. END
BEGIN NOW I could see the hair on this demonic dog, and the squirrel tails, and everything in clear Hi-def detail. END
BEGIN NOW Me and Drew saw the same thing. END
BEGIN NOW Drew left to get a closer look, the dog and associates still beckoning us in. END
BEGIN NOW Drew went to the fence line, as I stayed upstairs watching with the binoculars. END
BEGIN NOW Drew almost jumped the fence to join them, but I tapped on the window and shook my head. END
BEGIN NOW He came back up. END
BEGIN NOW We were tired, and wanted to go to sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Drew has bunk beds and Mike called the top bunk. END
BEGIN NOW I said fine, but asked that he at least give me my sleeping bag. END
BEGIN NOW He said no. END
BEGIN NOW 'Just give him his sleeping bag, Mike' Drew said. END
BEGIN NOW 'No.' END
BEGIN NOW I tried pulling it from him but to no avail. END
BEGIN NOW Annoyed, I gave up and went in the guest room trying to sleep, as a Spy VS Spy creature watched over me, which was very unsettling. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't actually sleep, and 'woke up' at around 7:30. END
BEGIN NOW I decided to read up on Datura, only when I got to the computer to do so, I couldn't read text. END
BEGIN NOW My vision was ok, but when I tried reading text smaller than billboard size, it was out of focus. END
BEGIN NOW This lasted for 2 more days, and during this time I thought I was never going to be able to read again. END
BEGIN NOW Same with Drew. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, the trip lasted all together for 3 days, and residues of it (like my eyes playing tricks on me) lasted for almost two weeks. END
BEGIN NOW I'll cut the other 2 days out, as it's already been a fairly verbose story. END
BEGIN NOW I shall summarize some though. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone was worried about us, they thought we were never coming down, and to be fair, neither did we. END
BEGIN NOW We saw Dr. Seuss creatures in trees, elves, gnomes, dwarves, pixies, demons, golems, all kinds of 
mythical/demonic/spiritual creatures. END
BEGIN NOW And everything Drew saw, I saw, and vice versa. END
BEGIN NOW We ran over a ghost with a car. END
BEGIN NOW Digital clocks would make Tamagachi-like animations. END
BEGIN NOW It looked 8-bit. END
BEGIN NOW The auditory hallucinations did stop after the first night, the visuals mostly after the third night. END
BEGIN NOW On the third day, me, Drew, and a group of our friends went into a gazebo (a usual smoking spot) in a garden to smoke. END
BEGIN NOW I saw gnomes having sex in the trees. END
BEGIN NOW Little creatures would slowly bring antennas up out of bushes, and whenever Drew and I would compare what we saw, our friends were like 'That's not fucking there! END
BEGIN NOW Stop it!' END
BEGIN NOW A train went by (we weren't that far from the tracks) and an obese naked woman was having sex with a tree just outside the garden Every time she went 'down' the train blew it's horn. END
BEGIN NOW The train was actually there, our friends acknowledged that. END
BEGIN NOW It was uncanny. END
BEGIN NOW She would stay down for three seconds, and the train would blow for three seconds. END
BEGIN NOW This experience has made me think about it every time I hear a train. END
BEGIN NOW I ran into J a few days later, and he thought we had never left. END
BEGIN NOW He hung out with 'us' all throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW Also, amazingly, Drew's parents, who were actually there the entire time, had no idea we were on anything. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know how, we were talking to people who weren't there, basically in front of them. END
BEGIN NOW We were lucky in that respect. END

BEGIN NOW I don't know if I believe in Hell, but if there is one, this is realm surely has some kind of correlation. END
BEGIN NOW Also, it has been said that Datura seeks you out, not the other way around. END
BEGIN NOW I deeply believe this to be true, and I believe that I was seeked out. END
BEGIN NOW I think J and Drew were caught in the crosshairs. END
BEGIN NOW To say this was just all in our minds is hard to justify. END
BEGIN NOW We interacted with people who weren't there simultaneously, witnessed the same things, and saw in blaring detail clearer images through binoculars. END
BEGIN NOW I omitted much of what happened, largely because of length, and largely because much of what I experienced I consider sacred, particularly some of the conversations. END
BEGIN NOW Not holy per se, but sacred. END
BEGIN NOW Also, I've found that the first encounter with an entheogen/ally sets the tone for the rest of the relationship. END
BEGIN NOW Toloache still visits me periodically in my dreams. END

BEGIN NOW Ever since I heard of Datura from a friend at school a few years ago, I have always tried to get a hold of some, asking dealers I knew from around town. END
BEGIN NOW But I was never successful, as many people I asked didn't even know what it was. END
BEGIN NOW So after awhile I gave up hope and continued with the usual, smoking grass everyday, occasionally scoring some ketamine or opium to make life a little more interesting. END
BEGIN NOW Then last year I finally got a chance to try the stuff. END
BEGIN NOW One of my friends told me he had gone to stay with his grandparents for a week and noticed a plant near their house that looked a lot like Datura, so he went over to it and sure enough he saw the small, spikey pods growing near the bottom of the plant. END
BEGIN NOW He himself didnt want to try any because he always feared any sort of hallucinogen because of the risk of a bad trip, but knew I had been wanting to try it for quite some time, so he picked one of the magical pods and wrapped it up in cellophane and brought them back for me. END
BEGIN NOW The bastard wouldnt hand them over unless I paid him 20 bucks, but I figured it would be well worth it. END
BEGIN NOW I couldnt wait to try them. END
BEGIN NOW First thing I did was found someone who would be a sitter for me, and that sitter was the most trustworthy friend I know (lets call him Steve). END
BEGIN NOW I asked my mom if he could sleep over and she said it was fine. END
BEGIN NOW So the next day, Steve came over around noon, and I got the seeds out of the pod and counted 37. END
BEGIN NOW I heard it only took like 10 or 15, and I wanted to have more so I could trip another time or sell them, so I decided to take 15. END
BEGIN NOW T:00.00 - Me and Steve went up to my room to take them. END
BEGIN NOW We put on some music and sat down in my bean bag chairs. END
BEGIN NOW I was feeling confident that things were going to go smoothly, mostly just because Steve was there with me, he was a very responsible person who I felt very safe and secure with. END
BEGIN NOW Of course I had a little butterflies in my stomach because I was taking something new, but it was mostly excitement, a total 'I cant wait' feeling. END
BEGIN NOW As Steve and I talked, I decided it was time, and pulled the sandwich baggie out of my pocket. END
BEGIN NOW I got all the seeds in my palm and looked at them, little teardrop shaped things, darkish brown, almost black. END
BEGIN NOW I thought to my self 'here goes nothing' and licked my palm to get all the seeds stuck on my tongue, chewed em up a bit, and swallowed. END
BEGIN NOW As they went down I got this overwhelming feeling of 'finally'. END
BEGIN NOW I have finally taken this crazy Datura, and in time I will be experiencing it. END
BEGIN NOW All I could do now is relax, keep the best state of mind I possibly could, and wait for things to kick in. END
BEGIN NOW T:00.30 - Went down to the kitchen with Steve to get a drink of water, and then went to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW No noticeable effects. END
BEGIN NOW Steve suggested we play video games while we wait for it to kick in. END
BEGIN NOW We went back to my room and played Mario Kart 64 and snacked on some doritos. END
BEGIN NOW T:00.50 - Starting to feel different. END
BEGIN NOW A lot like when you need to stretch really bad, but in my whole body. END
BEGIN NOW Mouth is getting dry, very similar to the cottonmouth after smoking a thick blunt. END
BEGIN NOW Steve is winning the game and I am loosing my grip on the controller, and I cant seem to keep the A button pushed down. END
BEGIN NOW After about 10 minutes I feel much different, very intense, and Im wondering why Steve is in my room playing video games. END
BEGIN NOW He reminds me that he is sleeping over to watch me because I took Datura. END
BEGIN NOW Right after he says this a wave of shock and fear run down my body like goosebumps, for I had completely forgotten the reason he was there, and that I had taken anything, although I do recall it, I am needless to say in shock at what just happened with my brain. END
BEGIN NOW I look at Steve and say 'calm me down', and somehow, Steve knew exactly what to do. END
BEGIN NOW He just smiled at me in this reassuring smile and said 'dont worry man, youre gonna have a blast' this made me feel incredibly better, and my mood shifted. END
BEGIN NOW After this, things seem to go back to normal, and I ask Steve to stop playing video games and go downstairs with me. END
BEGIN NOW We go downstairs into my kitchen and I pull a full pitcher of cherry kool-aid from the fridge. END
BEGIN NOW Steve got 2 glasses, then we went into my living room and sat down on the couch. END
BEGIN NOW I pour the both of us a glass and we sip it while watching tv. END
BEGIN NOW Afer I finish my glass I pick up the pitcher and gulp it down halfway. END
BEGIN NOW I am very thirsty, but the drink doesnt seem to quench my thirst at all, it seems to glide over the surface of my mouth, leaving it dry still. END
BEGIN NOW I now just try my best to ignore it, and continue watching tv. END
BEGIN NOW T:01:30 I tell Steve Ill be right back, and walk to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW While I piss I look at this picture above my toilet. END
BEGIN NOW Its a cartoon of a polar bear lying on its back in the water, holding a wine glass like it fell asleep from being drunk. END
BEGIN NOW The concept makes me want to laugh, it seems like the dumbest cartoon in the world to me, and its location is just as random as its contents. END
BEGIN NOW I think to my self 'why the f*** do we have a picture of a drunk polar bear in our bathroom'. END
BEGIN NOW For some reason, this seems near hysterical to me. END
BEGIN NOW I walk out of the bathroom and go back to the couch with Steve. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as I sit down, my mom walked out of the kitchen and tells us shes going to work and to behave, shell be back around 10. END
BEGIN NOW Steve and I say good bye and she leaves. END
BEGIN NOW Perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Now we have the house to ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW T:02:00 - Nothing much more seems to be happening. END
BEGIN NOW I have finished the pitcher of kool-aid and gone to the bathroom 2 more times. END
BEGIN NOW Steve says to go in the kitchen and refill the pitcher with water in case I feel like Im going to dehydrate. END
BEGIN NOW It seems like a responsible idea so I go into the kitchen and refill it with water and put ice cubes in it. END
BEGIN NOW I walk back into my living room to find Steve has left, and the tv has been turned off. END
BEGIN NOW The entire house is dead silent. END
BEGIN NOW Then I hear the tv go back on, but the screen is blank, and I hear Steve saying 'hey Im over here'. END
BEGIN NOW I realize that hes calling me from out in my backyard, so I put my shoes on and go outside. END
BEGIN NOW At first I scanned my back yard for him, but couldnt see him, and I couldnt hear him anymore. END
BEGIN NOW I suddenly get the idea that Steve had come over for a hide and seek game (at this point I have absolutely no idea that I have taken anything) so I run into the yard looking around for him. END
BEGIN NOW Then I speak 'come out come out where ever you are' . END
BEGIN NOW Right when I say this my voice sounds very different, like a person who has gone totally insane. END
BEGIN NOW This starts to scare me very much, and Steve is nowhere to be found. END
BEGIN NOW I look way across to the other end of my yard (my yard is only about a 100 foot by 200 foot area, but now it was a soccer field size) and at the other end I see my dogs pen, a fenced in area in the corner with all my friends who are straight edge that stopped being friends with me when I started smoking pot. END
BEGIN NOW I havent seen them in so long, so I run towards the pen. END
BEGIN NOW They look just as happy to see me as I am to see them, and they let me into the pen. END
BEGIN NOW We start talking and to my surprise, one of them pulls a blunt out of nowhere and sparks it. END
BEGIN NOW I am naturally amused but shocked, then they start to explain to me that they came to see me cause they all 'got into the game' and dont think drugs are that bad after all. END
BEGIN NOW On the outside I am pleased to hear this, but on the inside I begin to get feelings of untrust. END
BEGIN NOW These bastards abandoned me years back. END
BEGIN NOW I dont show any unpleasant feelings on the outside, and I continue to be cheery with them, although I keep a state of mind not to trust anyone there. END
BEGIN NOW They pass me the blunt and I take a super long hit, and hold it super long and blow out. END
BEGIN NOW After it went around a few times we all spark a cigarette to increase our high. END
BEGIN NOW We just keep talking and talking. END
BEGIN NOW It seems like time has stopped. END
BEGIN NOW How long can people just sit here and talk? END
BEGIN NOW Its been hours, I think to myself (strangely enough I am still puffing on the same cigarette, but dont notice anything unusual about it). END
BEGIN NOW Then I drop my butt, and it falls under the chair Im sitting on. END
BEGIN NOW 'Ah Shit' I said and got out of my seat to get it. END
BEGIN NOW I look under the chair but I cant seem to find it. END
BEGIN NOW 'Did any of you see were my...' as I turn around I notice no one is there, and I am alone in the pen. END
BEGIN NOW A sense of anger comes over me, and I get intense feelings of 'I shouldnt have trusted them' and 'how dare they'. END
BEGIN NOW These feelings are followed by loneliness and then total fear. END
BEGIN NOW I need to get out of this pen and go back in the house. END
BEGIN NOW I walk back to my house across the long field, and it seems to take even longer to go back than when I had come. END
BEGIN NOW Next thing I know Im back in my kitchen lying on the floor very sweaty, Steve is there sitting on the kitchen counter. END
BEGIN NOW My focus is very blurred and 'off' and I feel very confused about why hes there on the counter and Im on the floor, but every few moments I kinda snap back into reality and know exactly what going on, then snap back into delirium and totally forget everything. END
BEGIN NOW Next thing I know its already 6:46am and I am running late. END
BEGIN NOW My mom tells me I only got a half hour to get ready or ill get a Saturday detention. END
BEGIN NOW I scramble out of bed and run into the bathroom to take a shower. END
BEGIN NOW I suddenly realize how mush schools gonna suck cause I forgot to do my homework and I have an oral presentation due today. END
BEGIN NOW All these thoughts make me panic and I know theres no way out of it cause I already skipped school 3 times this year and got caught and I cant skip another day or I have to go to court. END
BEGIN NOW I get out of the shower and dry off as quickly as I can. END
BEGIN NOW Then I run into my room and get dressed and go downstairs to the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW Right then I noticed something was wrong, the clock said 1:00am and the calendar was on July. END
BEGIN NOW No body was up. END
BEGIN NOW My mom was asleep and had been asleep. END
BEGIN NOW She didnt wake me up for school, I did not have school in summer. END
BEGIN NOW I wished I was dreaming, and the thoughts in my mind were on the brink of driving me insane. END
BEGIN NOW All I remember after this is running back up into my room in total panic ready to cry and scream and if one more weird thing happened I was gonna commit suicide. END
BEGIN NOW I woke up in my bed with Steve on the floor watching me, he looked very concerned and asked me if I was ok now, if I was still tripping. END
BEGIN NOW I didnt know what to say to him, cause right then I could have still be tripping for all I know. END
BEGIN NOW It was 5:00pm the next day, I had a bad headache and couldnt focus on shit, and my whole body was in this dreadfully uncomfortable state. END
BEGIN NOW It took me awhile to collect my thoughts and figure out I was not tripping anymore, and I had these series of very strange realistic dreams stuck in my head from when I was asleep, but I cant for the life of me remember what they were now, I forgot them completely about 4 hours after I woke up. END
BEGIN NOW From Steves point of view, in a nutshell, I had started acting weird when I had gotten the water from the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW He said that he was trying to talk to me but I would just have this blank stare like I couldnt see him, and then ran outside into my shed in the backyard and started talking to myself, and after an hour or so I ran out of the shed with this scared shitless look on my face and fell down, and crawled back into the house, into the bathroom and he said I was trying to drink out of the toilet, he pulled me up and carried me into the kitchen and put down on the floor and got some ice for me. END
BEGIN NOW He said I was talking in my sleep and saying random words in no logical order whatsoever but I was saying them fluently like I knew what I was talking about. END
BEGIN NOW Before my mom came home, he carried me upstairs and put me to bed, and stayed up to watch me, and he said I was talking out loud and moving around like I was having nightmares, and around midnight I sprang out of bed and ran into the bathroom and got in the shower for an hour and then went back into my room and put a shirt on backwards and some boxers but no pants and ran downstairs and stood in the kitchen for 10 minutes, just standing there. END
BEGIN NOW He said then I freaked out and ran upstairs into my room and he said he had to push me onto my bed and hold me down until I stopped moving, and eventually fell asleep, then he did. END
BEGIN NOW He woke up around 10 that day and I slept till 5. END
BEGIN NOW To sum it up in one word...insanity. END
BEGIN NOW Thats what if feels like if you start to snap out of it and realize whats happening, but then you just go back into this state of total confusion and its enough to drive anyone crazy. END
BEGIN NOW Overall I am glad I experienced this, just to know what its like, but this is not for everyone, and Im not saying the experience was at all pleasant, so I have no motivation to do it again anytime soon, maybe someday years from now just for some crazy fun. END
BEGIN NOW But this Datura seems to be something not of this world. END
BEGIN NOW The hallucinations were accompanied by delirium and confusion which made them seem real and like I wasnt really tripping. END
BEGIN NOW This stuff truly is THE DEVILS WEED. END
BEGIN NOW So... END
BEGIN NOW I decided to take Datura orally for the first time at Burning Man in 2006. END
BEGIN NOW A couple months earlier I had smoked the flowers for the first time with my mother, and she had sent me off to the desert with a Ziploc full of dried leaves and flowers. END
BEGIN NOW Smoking the flowers, as others have reported is a slightly less relaxing buzz than that of marijuana (though surprisingly similar). END
BEGIN NOW Given the choice, I think I'd always pick marijuana, because it tastes better and it's less edgy. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow, fast forward to Black Rock City, a few days into the burn. END
BEGIN NOW I'm there with my sister, 3 year old nephew and girlfriend of many years. END
BEGIN NOW We decide that I'll be the first to do this, and perhaps that they will try some the next night, depending on how it goes for me. END
BEGIN NOW I make sun tea out of the flowers, stems and leaves by stuffing a bunch of them into a waterbottle, and sitting it on top of the van until the sun goes down. END
BEGIN NOW I mix some up with a chai tea, and do my best to get it down. END
BEGIN NOW A pretty foul brew, and of course I make that choice I always recognize as foolish later - after my initial dose, and waiting for a short while, I feel nothing and decide to pour myself another dose. END
BEGIN NOW Almost immediately, the first dose kicks in. END
BEGIN NOW Considering the anti-emetic effects, I am lucky to vomit almost right away before it becomes impossible, kicking out some of that second dose before it piles on top of the first one. END
BEGIN NOW There's a process of being taken to the porta-potties and back to camp by my g/f. END
BEGIN NOW At this point, I'm having difficulty tracking the proper direction to and from these destinations, and an intense, horrid thirst. END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely the most parched I've ever felt in my life, and I don't have my water bottle with me during the trek. END
BEGIN NOW It's not pleasant in the least, and I'm squeezing my g/fs hand very hard, being mean and cranky and difficult to sit for, constantly pulling her off course and complaining loudly about how frustratingly thirsty I am as we make this little journey. END
BEGIN NOW Fortunately, this was probably the worst part of the whole experience, and things began to get better as soon as I managed to get back to camp and ingest some fluids. END
BEGIN NOW Nonetheless, things are coming on strong, with a lot of body buzz. END
BEGIN NOW After a small bit of exploring in camp, including apparently unsuccessful attempts to touch the pink flamingo attached to the van antenna, I decide that before I'm ready to deal with the world in this new state, I'm going to need to lie down in the van on the mattress and relax under the covers, and get used to my body. END
BEGIN NOW As I say to my companions, 'I feel like my feet are made out of something other than feet'. END
BEGIN NOW I spend some time in the dark, expecting the kalidescope fractals of other hallucinogens, but there's actually very little of this. END
BEGIN NOW I spend a bit of time reading (I think it was Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, but it may have been Inifinite Jest - I really can't remember at this point, except that it was one of my two large blue books, so it had to be one of them) and discover the visual distortion that will follow me through the evening. END
BEGIN NOW To wit, everything appears to be about six inches closer to me than it actually is (explaining my failure to make contact with the flamingo earlier that so amused my companions). END
BEGIN NOW I discover this because I'm unable to read my book with my glasses on, but if I take them off and hold the book at a normal distance, I'm able to read the book just as I would if I were holding it too close to my face with them off. END
BEGIN NOW Now, after a bit of accustoming myself to my new world, I get up out of bed and decide that it's time to play. END
BEGIN NOW My sister and g/f are not in camp when I climb out of the van and, reflecting on how unpleasant the trip to the bathroom with the g/f had been, decided to throw caution to the wind and left camp without a babysitter. END
BEGIN NOW When I eventually returned, I discovered that this had, of course, totally throw them for a loop, and that my g/f had a pretty good panic and went hunting for me, unsuccessfully. END
BEGIN NOW Once I set out on foot, I found that, while still present, the sensation of increased gravity began to lift away and my spirits rose. END
BEGIN NOW Other than the issue of depth perception, which made it seem to the people around me that I was trying to pet the things I was really trying to reach for, I didn't have the noticeable fluid visual hallucinations associate with many other hallucinogens. END
BEGIN NOW But, with the fact that I was at Burning Man of all places, and my lack of a babysitter to corroborate my story with, I frankly have no idea what I saw and heard that was real and what was purely a construct of my mind, making it hard to piece together a narrative of my experiences. END
BEGIN NOW I definitely experienced some disorientation, occasionally wandering into other peoples camps inappropriately. END
BEGIN NOW I was also subject to the phantom cigarettes and other items that so many other users report. END
BEGIN NOW In my case, I also had a phantom water bottle. END
BEGIN NOW I suspect that this phenomenon, while most commonly reported with the cigarettes, is actually something that is a user subjective occurence based on whatever repetetive actions they commonly perform. END
BEGIN NOW This would explain the water bottle for me (as keeping hydrated is the most common repetetive action I have going on out there on the Playa), and what I've heard for other people, like gamers who will fall into playing a game with a phantom controller. END
BEGIN NOW I had an extensive conversation with one fellow sitting under the scavenger hunt board, who I assumed was real, and a few other people encounters, but I do not recall imagining meetings with people I know, which seems to be something most people do run into. END
BEGIN NOW Instead, the most unusual effect is that I had what I can only call hallucinatory memories. END
BEGIN NOW I would find myself acting on a memory of something said or done, only to realize that not only had I not actually had the conversation or taken the action that triggered what I was doing, but that I hadn't even hallucinated the conversation or action, but that I was remembering something I had not experienced at all. END
BEGIN NOW Disconcerting, to say the least! END
BEGIN NOW One such scenario happened as I was trying to find my way back to our camp, and realized that I was bearing in the wrong direction, because I remembered distinctly having a discussion with someone about how a whole row of sites had been moved one row further out. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly I realized that there was no way that would have happened, and that the conversation hadn't actually happened, nor had I even experienced a hallucinatory conversation, and that I was remembering something completely false. END
BEGIN NOW I also spent quite some time searching for my bicycle, which I had distinct memories of leaving... somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW In a very dreamlike state, I would wander looking for it, lose track of my self, start doing something else and then remember that I needed to find my bike. END
BEGIN NOW Eventually I gave it up for lost, and I did make it back to camp and reassured everyone that I was still alive and OK. END
BEGIN NOW I had never had my bike with me, it was in camp the whole time. END
BEGIN NOW After a bit, I decided that I had had probably about enough of Datura world, so I took 25mg of Trazodone which put me to sleep and allowed me to sleep well into the heat of the next day. END
BEGIN NOW Normally, I hate using Trazodone as a sleep aid, as it tends to require a very long window in which to rest (12-16 hours), or I'm unable to function the next day, but in this case, that was just what I needed. END
BEGIN NOW The next day I was still mildly disassociated, but I didn't have the multiday ongoing trip that many users report. END
BEGIN NOW Again, I think I was probably pretty fortunate to vomit early on, or I expect I would have had an even longer stranger trip. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't taken an oral dosage of it since, but I found my experience to be pretty positive overall, and have definitely considered doing it again. END
BEGIN NOW The environment I was in was, I think, a big part of why it was so positive - I can see why taking this drug around a lot of straight folks in a real city, instead of the sea of freaks in a temporary city, might be overwhelming and much more difficult to maintain. END
BEGIN NOW Running off without my sitter was unwise, and a bit rude of me, but I don't think I would have enjoyed that particular individual sitting me for the trip, so it turned out to be a good thing. END
BEGIN NOW If I do it again, I think I'd really like to have a partner in the experience to compare with, as well as a sober sitter to keep an eye on us. END
BEGIN NOW Both my girlfriend and sister chose not to imbibe, but I believe I was able to pass some on to another burner, though I don't recall ever getting any feedback from him on how it went. END
BEGIN NOW What follows are the events of my first two experimental Datura trips. END
BEGIN NOW Im a 21 year old, 200 pound male experienced psychonaut, having used nearly all common psychedelics multiple times, as well as all but one 2C chemical. END
BEGIN NOW Im an uncanny hard head to most psychedelic compounds (much to my dismay) which means I can rarely achieve the level of experience as many other experience report authors, unless taking an immensely high dose. END
BEGIN NOW The Datura inoxia I used was found on my college campus, and it is definitely a genuine, native specimen. END
BEGIN NOW I have spent much of this year researching and reading on the tropane alkaloid containing plants (Datura, belladonna, mandrake, brugmansia, and henbane to name a few). END
BEGIN NOW I had my heart set on belladonna, but recently I discovered a perfectly good Datura shrub, and that gave me the inspiration to begin. END
BEGIN NOW Both of these experiments were done indoors, in a large house with 21 members. END
BEGIN NOW They were all good friends, and a few of them knew what I was planning to do. END
BEGIN NOW I chose two experienced trip sitters to read a handful of Datura trip reports and the Datura-sitting guidelines, just in case things went sour. END
BEGIN NOW Experiment one: 

T-0:00 (3:00pm): Ground up 50 small Datura inoxia seeds in a mortar and pestle. END
BEGIN NOW The seed coats are exceedingly durable, and the mortar and pestle did very little to truly crush them. END
BEGIN NOW Moisture was expelled from them only after a long period of crushing. END
BEGIN NOW I chewed them as much as I could, and washed them down with water. END
BEGIN NOW Despite intense bitterness, I was able to choke them down with minimal gagging. END
BEGIN NOW This is a test run for me; I find it highly unlikely that the small dose will affect me. END
BEGIN NOW Fortunately, you can always take more after the fact, but you can never take less. END
BEGIN NOW At 200 pounds, this may be one of the smallest dose to weight ratios for which there is a plausible experience report. END
BEGIN NOW T+0:50: Ive begun to feel the gradual placebo come up; something I often feel when very anxious about a new drug. END
BEGIN NOW Its nearly certainly psychological, but to enhance the feeling, I smoked 10 seeds of Datura Inoxia out of a waterless bong. END
BEGIN NOW They smoke surprisingly well, and the taste, although slightly acrid, isnt entirely unpleasant. END
BEGIN NOW Its difficult to inhale once a certain smoke volume is reached, and the seeds taste much like a cross between burning marshmallow and gasoline. END
BEGIN NOW Taking large bong rips is completely out of the question due to the power of the smoke. END
BEGIN NOW The smoking has elicited a rather dry mouth, as expected, but only slight changes in perception. END
BEGIN NOW T+1:00: Another 10 seeds were smoked, this time with water added to the bong. END
BEGIN NOW This markedly increased the volume able to be inhaled. END
BEGIN NOW Sensory effects have begun to grow, but only slightly. END
BEGIN NOW T+2:00: Ive been trying to sleep for the last hour and surprisingly it was a comfortable nap. END
BEGIN NOW However, the effects were very faint. END
BEGIN NOW I had difficulty focusing on things, much like trying to view something after staring at the sun for a while. END
BEGIN NOW But the one way I knew that it was working was the dry mouth and throat; it was completely impossible to rehydrate; water simply seemed to run off the dry lining of my throat rather than absorbing into it. END
BEGIN NOW T+4:00 no new effects have cropped up, aside from more noticeable dry throat and an increase in epidermal discomfort; I felt as though I was wearing a wool jumpsuit with nothing over it. END
BEGIN NOW My friend and I cooked a delicious pizza, but I found it to be tasteless and dry due to the supreme lack of saliva in my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW It filled me up, but didnt grant me even the slightest pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW T+6:00: I feel to be coming down already which is uncommon according to most Datura trip reports. END
BEGIN NOW The sore throat has gotten markedly better, my vision is slightly off kilter but barely noticeably so, and the skin irritation is no longer present. END
BEGIN NOW Ill probably call it a night early, and for the next experiment, either double the seed dose and/or smoke the leaves and roots. END
BEGIN NOW A tea may also help. END
BEGIN NOW T+14:00: Feel much better this morning, although it has reminded me of how unpleasant the earlier night had been. END
BEGIN NOW Im certainly not looking forward to upping the dosage... END
BEGIN NOW Experience 2: 

T-0:00: I chose to up the dosage considerably on my second experiment with Datura, picking one fresh flower, four fresh leaves, and roughly 300 seeds. END
BEGIN NOW I pulverized them all in a mortar and pestle until there was a soggy wad. END
BEGIN NOW This wad was added to 1.5 cups of boiling water, and I allowed fifteen minutes to elapse for the solution to concentrate and release the tropane alkaloids. END
BEGIN NOW One cup of the water evaporated in the boiling process, leaving 12 cup. END
BEGIN NOW I strained this with a coffee filter into another cup filled with lemonade and fruit punch. END
BEGIN NOW In this mixture, the Datura wasnt even noticeable. END
BEGIN NOW T+1:00: The dry mouth is already in full swing, and by body does not feel good at all. END
BEGIN NOW There are pins and needles all over me, and no amount of rubbing helps. END
BEGIN NOW I have also grown extremely unbalanced, almost exactly how I feel while intoxicated with alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW I generally am holding on to something as I wander around my house, to keep from tripping (physically). END
BEGIN NOW T+2:00: Ive fallen into some sort of hypnotic hibernation. END
BEGIN NOW I feel too lousy to walk around, my eyes hurt too much to open, and the spring water I drink is indistinguishable from puddle water. END
BEGIN NOW So I sit on my love sack, eyes closed, body intensely irritated. END
BEGIN NOW At one point, needing to go to the bathroom, I got up and swayed my way to the toilet. END
BEGIN NOW In my experience, walking while on Datura is much like walking blindfolded in a boulder field. END
BEGIN NOW Its impossible to tell when my feet are going to land on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Occasionally it felt as though I was walking with one foot on the sidewalk and one on the road. END
BEGIN NOW Urination is highly abnormal: I pee for much longer than average, but the volume expelled is significantly smaller. END
BEGIN NOW Also, after finishing, I feel like I need to go even worse than before. END
BEGIN NOW T+3:00: I believe I finally got into bed at this point, and that is where the trip truly started. END
BEGIN NOW Its very difficult to explain, but I began to have the ability to switch between reality and dreams. END
BEGIN NOW One minute, in my minds eye, Id be sitting in a field, speaking to a friend or two (in my head, not out loud). END
BEGIN NOW Id jerk my eyes open and return swiftly to lying in bed. END
BEGIN NOW But the second my eyes closed again, there I was in an entirely new setting. END
BEGIN NOW The most incredible thing about these dream hallucinations was the speed with which they unraveled. END
BEGIN NOW I was literally having about six small dreams a minute, ranging from a quick brusque conversation to weeding a garden. END
BEGIN NOW Despite how mundane they were, it was always very peculiar to choose when to awake. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldnt call these lucid dreams, because I was not in control of what I was dreaming; I could only manipulate the point when I started and when I ended the dream. END
BEGIN NOW Very few times, during what I assume were slightly more realistic dreams, I even woke myself up by speaking out loud rather than in my head. END
BEGIN NOW (Ive never talked or walked in my sleep.) END
BEGIN NOW T+5:00: Im woken up by some friends (they were not imaginary this time,) and we went downstairs to play some poker and then participate in a fraternity initiation ritual. END
BEGIN NOW The game had already started, and I was told to pick out my chips to buy in. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I counted out my chips and sat down at the table. END
BEGIN NOW Did you get your chips, F? END
BEGIN NOW I hear. END
BEGIN NOW Looking down, I see that there were no chips there. END
BEGIN NOW Embarrassed, I got up and counted out the chips again. END
BEGIN NOW I played five or so hands, but had a very difficult time reading the cards, and often made poor bets because I saw a four of hearts when it was really a five of diamonds. END
BEGIN NOW The ritual began, and I spent most of the time with my head down, testing the dreamlands once again. END
BEGIN NOW I took to having the same dream over and over again, in which I pick up a golden hexagonal prism. END
BEGIN NOW Each time, I tried to awaken still holding the box, but of course my fist was always tightly clenched around nothing. END
BEGIN NOW T+7:00: The ritual ends, and Ive finally managed to get to bed. END
BEGIN NOW The dreams are growing longer and more difficult to awaken from, and I think the effects are starting to wear off. END
BEGIN NOW T+9:00: I wake up again to lead another ritual, but Im so delirious at this point that Im unable to speak much and (for all I know) really frightening the pledges. END
BEGIN NOW Mercifully the ritual does not take much time at all, and Im able to return to bed. END
BEGIN NOW Although the sleep is fitful, I manage to fall into normal rest. END
BEGIN NOW T+15:00: The major effects are long gone, but I still feel slightly irritated. END
BEGIN NOW I have quite severe nearsightedness under normal circumstances, hovering around 20/100 in both eyes. END
BEGIN NOW However, at this point, the condition seems to have reversed. END
BEGIN NOW While normally I read with the book 8 inches away from my eyes, I cannot even begin to make out the letters with less that 12 inches distance between the page and my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW T+18:00: The rest of the day has turned out to get significantly better, although my short term memory is utterly destroyed. END
BEGIN NOW Ive been starting conversations, and in seconds, completely losing track of what we were talking about. END
BEGIN NOW Ive even lost the will to try and remember what the topic is. END
BEGIN NOW Im sure things will return to baseline by tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW Conclusion: This experience was much more like the average Datura report, in that it included a thin line between reality and surreality. END
BEGIN NOW I dont think I reached the level Im trying for yet, but this dose is very close. END
BEGIN NOW I believe I have one more attempt left in me before I leave Datura alone and move on to something with less of a body load and unpleasant side effects. END
BEGIN NOW However, I wish to give a good long time to prepare even more. END
BEGIN NOW Afterthought: I absolutely love altering my conscious, no matter how (Drugs, pain, meditation, or even things like removing my sight for a day). END
BEGIN NOW However, this drug is certainly not something I would seek out if I were looking for a good time. END
BEGIN NOW Although I wouldnt call this a negative or a positive experience, I believe that an overwhelming majority of people should avoid it. END
BEGIN NOW Just because it grows like a weed doesnt mean you should treat it like one. END
BEGIN NOW Some people say that each plant has a spirit associated with it. END
BEGIN NOW If marijuanas spirit is a laid-back, spacey woman, Daturas is a cunning and tricky sorceress. END
BEGIN NOW Even after years of Salvia experience, I believe Datura is fathoms more powerful, simply due to how permanently it can rip you from reality. END
BEGIN NOW I was with a few friends one night when I saw a plant with small cactus pods. END
BEGIN NOW I remembered having heard about it before when I was a few years younger. END
BEGIN NOW They were called Jimson weed. END
BEGIN NOW The word around the campfire was that if you cut open the pod and let the seeds dry out, they will turn brown and be edible. END
BEGIN NOW I had never heard anything about dosage, although, I seem to recall hearing something about eating no more than half a pod, though I am unsure if that was when I first discovered Datura or after my friends took it at my first encounter with it. END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, I took a few pods off the plant and decided to share them with other psychonauts I knew. END
BEGIN NOW I could not find the few people I knew would have tried it so I dried out a couple pods, anyway. END
BEGIN NOW A couple days later I saw that the seeds had turned gustably brown. END
BEGIN NOW At about 7:00P.M. END
BEGIN NOW I swallowed about half a pod which I estimated to contain about 280-320 seeds. END
BEGIN NOW I guess about two hours had passed until I started to feel the effects. END
BEGIN NOW I had no idea what to expect. END
BEGIN NOW I was watching something on TV with the lights off. END
BEGIN NOW I started to feel dissappointed. END
BEGIN NOW I got up to get a drink, or something, and I felt very heavy and lost my balance when I stood up. END
BEGIN NOW I remember telling myself 'wow, I am flying! END
BEGIN NOW I am really flying! END
BEGIN NOW '(the enthusiasm about flying came from my previous notions about powerful drugs like that: they will make you feel like you can fly). END
BEGIN NOW At that pseudoaerial moment the feelings were pleasant and euphoric until a vicious feeling of a cotton-mouth hit me. END
BEGIN NOW I 'glided' to the sink and got a drink. END
BEGIN NOW A few seconds later I had the same cotton mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I had terrible balance and poor depth perception(greatly reduced ability to know how far away anything was from my grasp). END
BEGIN NOW My friend Chris came home and didn't seem to notice anything was awry. END
BEGIN NOW Then my mum came home. END
BEGIN NOW it must have been near 8:00-30 now. END
BEGIN NOW It was November at the time and quite cold in Woodstock, Canada. END
BEGIN NOW I had been seeing some fast, black dots streaking across the room like a fly buzzing around. END
BEGIN NOW I remarked to my mum and Chris that I thought it 'amazing that flies are still buzzing around this late into November. END
BEGIN NOW I thought they all would have frozen.' END
BEGIN NOW They had no idea what I was talking about. END
BEGIN NOW The next thing I remember after my 'flies in November' observation was putting somebody's boot on the countertop and inserting various items like a pencil, a salt shaker, crackers, a fork, a small booklet and other small objects, into the boot. END
BEGIN NOW I can only remember telling my mum and Chris that I had some purpose to my actions; that it was a vital task I had to undertake. END
BEGIN NOW After I put all the random objects into the boot I put it back on the shoe mat, carefully and methodically. END
BEGIN NOW After that I stumbled to the fridge and became frustrated after attempting to grab a hold of the fridge handle. END
BEGIN NOW I could not sense how far away the handle was. END
BEGIN NOW I finally got it, flustered and nearly exhausted from so many failed attempts to open it. END
BEGIN NOW I just stared listlessly into the fridge and grabbed a carton of soy milk. END
BEGIN NOW I looked at it, astonished at what I was holding. END
BEGIN NOW With my eyes wide open and mouth ajar as if I had just prevented a lit cigarette in my dust bin from igniting some tissues and newspapers on fire, I asked Chris, 'wow, Chris! END
BEGIN NOW Where did I get this?' END
BEGIN NOW 'Uhhh, the fridge,' he said. END
BEGIN NOW At this point they still didn't grasp the seriousness of just how stoned I was. END
BEGIN NOW They were aware that I was acting strangely, but couldn't think of anything that would have had that effect on me. END
BEGIN NOW My mum was a bit worried and deduced that I must have taken something, and told Chris to keep an eye on me. END
BEGIN NOW It must have been around 9:30-10:00, about two or three hours into the ordeal, when I found myself in the bathroom, several times, as I kept walking in and out after completing some job. END
BEGIN NOW I remember holding an oval soap dish with a brown and golden ancient Egyptian border around it. END
BEGIN NOW I kept trying to wash it off and then I would place it on its side when I finished. END
BEGIN NOW Chris was standing at the bathroom door the whole time without my noticing him, just watching what I was doing the way someone would watch a physical altercation unfolding across a parking lot, waiting to see if it would become serious or violent before getting involved. END
BEGIN NOW Every once in a while I would realise he was there and tell him that things needed to be cleaned and that there was some problem in the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW The most severe (if that is the right word) thing I remember from that night was waliking into the bathroom again. END
BEGIN NOW I looked at the mirror and noticed I had a small, white stain on my Jimi Hendrix t-shirt. END
BEGIN NOW I tried to rub it off and remarked to the stranger in the mirror that we had the same stain. END
BEGIN NOW Just seconds later I pointed out that we also had the same shirt. END
BEGIN NOW I became quite irritated and defensive about this imposter in my bathroom and bitterly said to him 'get the fuck out of my house! END
BEGIN NOW What are doin' in my house? END
BEGIN NOW Dude, you need to get the fuck out, now!' END
BEGIN NOW Chris just watched in shock. END
BEGIN NOW Who could ever have imagined it possible for a person to forget his own reflection? END
BEGIN NOW and then become enraged at it, too? END
BEGIN NOW He calmed me down and assured me that I was overreacting. END
BEGIN NOW I have no memory of what I did immediately after that. END
BEGIN NOW I think I blacked out, but I was still walking around. END
BEGIN NOW My memory seemed to have shut off. END
BEGIN NOW The next thing I remember, quite suddenly, as if my memory had been turned on again, was standing in the bathroom looking at my mum as she extracted a body towel, a hand towel and a face cloth from the toilet. END
BEGIN NOW I had no idea what was going on. END
BEGIN NOW She looked really worried about me. END
BEGIN NOW She kept asking Chris what I took but he didn't know either and they couldn't get any sensible answer from me. END
BEGIN NOW I have a very vague memory of having some complex purpose for putting the towels in the toilet. END
BEGIN NOW During all this, by the way, I had still had the savage dry mouth, so I had been drinking water periodically. END
BEGIN NOW At around 12:30 A.M., five and a half hours after I had ingested the seeds, I had still been plagued by the abrasive cotton-mouth, and by a painfully full bladder because of all the water I had drunk to quench it. END
BEGIN NOW I had not been able to urinate at all during the peak effects or during any of my adventures in the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW All the water had added up and hurt my bladder immensely. END
BEGIN NOW I could not manage even a small drop of urine despite the obvious need to do so. END
BEGIN NOW I am not sure how much time passed after the incident with the towels, but my best guess is about 1.5-two hours. END
BEGIN NOW During the night's final stages my sense of identity returned along with my motor coordination, but I began to have unpleasantly vivid, tactile hallucinations of translucent spiders with long, curly tails composed of what seemed like fishing line. END
BEGIN NOW They had made me very agitated and paranoid because they had been crawling up the walls, on the floor around me, up my legs, in my hair and up the curtains. END
BEGIN NOW There were not swarms of them, as you might have inferred, but roughly a dozen or more visible at any moment. END
BEGIN NOW I became quite distressed about the situation because they felt very real. END
BEGIN NOW Wherever I looked I could see that their long, cumbersome tails had been making them very clumsy as they crawled. END
BEGIN NOW The hallucinations were so overwhelmingly vivid and tactile because whenever I stepped on their 'tails' they illusively tripped up, or got snagged beneath my feet and struggled to go anywhere, whether along the floor, or up the walls. END
BEGIN NOW The sensations were so tactile that I felt itchy as they stumbled up my arms and legs. END
BEGIN NOW I was not scared or overly distraught, or anywhere near panicking, as one would assume, but paranoid and overwrought. END
BEGIN NOW I compulsively scanned the room for them and tried to see where they had all come from. END
BEGIN NOW They had been combing the room like white smoke, everywhere I looked. END
BEGIN NOW My mood changed from being tensely agitated to immensely irritated by them. END
BEGIN NOW After repeated attempts from anxiety to squash them with my feet, my vengeful efforts to rid my home of these clumsy, hybrid creatures led me to summon my dog Lucy for help. END
BEGIN NOW I commanded her to 'get 'em!' END
BEGIN NOW and pointed to them, floundering and limping beneath her snout. END
BEGIN NOW She just wagged her tail as she sniffed the floor, frantically trying to get what I was pointing at and then promotly returned to her original position to listen to whatever I said. END
BEGIN NOW The next day, Chris told me I had been talking to Lucy seriously, as if she were conversing with me and satisfying my curiosity about whatever topic. END
BEGIN NOW She followed me everywhere I went, always at my heels or sat attentively in front of me. END
BEGIN NOW There was one point during my experience, despite the distressing hallucinations that absorbed me, when I realised with a small degree of deliberate cognizance, Lucy's bizarre (who's calling who bizarre?) END
BEGIN NOW behaviour and sensed that she knew something was wrong with me. END
BEGIN NOW She had a concerned, penetrating look in her eyes every time I had stopped wandering. END
BEGIN NOW Once again the agonising urge to urinate brought me back to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW I could still see the spiders climbing everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW I must have stood at the toilet with my pants down for twenty minutes, or more, while I tried to pee. END
BEGIN NOW I was too distracted by all the spiders struggling to climb up the toilet bowl. END
BEGIN NOW I flushed the toilet and they all managed to stay on the surface of the water. END
BEGIN NOW Eventually I started to pee,painfully and only a little at first. END
BEGIN NOW It definitely wasn't a situation I would want anybody seeing. END
BEGIN NOW I think the determination to drown the spiders in piss made myself able to finally pee. END
BEGIN NOW I had such a long, orgasmic emiction, perhaps the longest I have ever had. END
BEGIN NOW After that I went to bed, brought Lucy up, and had a conversation with her about work. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know how long I had been conversing with her when I suddenly came to my senses and said to myself, 'what the fuck is wrong with me? END
BEGIN NOW I was just talking to my dog,' and laughed. END
BEGIN NOW I was very glad when that was over. END
BEGIN NOW Would I do it again? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, now that I know what to expect. END
BEGIN NOW Next time I will have ice cubes at my disposal to relieve the dry mouth, this way I won't have to drink copiously. END
BEGIN NOW The Entree: 

25 finely chewed seeds of Datura Stramonium, aged to racemize the hyoscyamine to atropine and the scopolamine to atroscine. END
BEGIN NOW Each seed is roughly 7-8 mgs, but alkaloid content of each seed varies too much to be consistent. END
BEGIN NOW 2 bowls of Blueberry Kush, cured to decarboxylate the THCA, and smoked approximately two hours after ingestion of the Datura. END
BEGIN NOW I eye the small cluster of black, teardrop-shaped seeds in the palm of my hand with a mix of apprehension and usual pre-trip anxiety. END
BEGIN NOW They taste bitter with a hint of an earthy bite; not bad by any means but the hard husks get stuck in my teeth. END
BEGIN NOW I chew well and let the mass sit in my mouth for a few minutes to aid any sublingual absorption, and prepare to joyously delve into the bowels of torment and despair. END
BEGIN NOW The Trip: 

Eyes closed, pitch blackness. END
BEGIN NOW A sense of evil, a seductively malevolent vibe. END
BEGIN NOW Apprehension as the gears of my perspective slowly creak into the lower planes. END
BEGIN NOW Streaking spirals of light, growing brighter and brighter until... suddenly, break through. END
BEGIN NOW People and landscapes in perfect clarity as if I were watching through an invisible camera. END
BEGIN NOW A man turns towards his wife before stabbing her violently in the back. END
BEGIN NOW He rips the peeling flesh from her body as insects suddenly pour out. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW A pool of blood, undulating with red waves. END
BEGIN NOW Body parts falling in, silently splashing. END
BEGIN NOW No sound whatsoever to these visions. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW A wolf, black eyes, digging into an unidentifiable corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Strings of meat are dangling between its teeth. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW Many scenes of erotica, usually ending in gory climax. END
BEGIN NOW My skull is but a padded cell, the walls of which my inner demons bounce off. END
BEGIN NOW Themes of sadomasochism, violence punctuated by guilty pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW I hear sounds of sheer chaos. END
BEGIN NOW Screams, thumps. END
BEGIN NOW Dragging noises. END
BEGIN NOW Someone calling my name, louder, and louder. END
BEGIN NOW A gentle hiss and a bump. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW Spiders. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of spiders, pouring through the cracks of reality as if puncturing through this thin veil of ordinary life. END
BEGIN NOW I feel things gently running over my body. END
BEGIN NOW I don't open my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW Swinging bodies on nooses, burning. END
BEGIN NOW Fire, blood dripping as maggots squirm into the quivering flesh. END
BEGIN NOW I am carrying on a conversation with something, but I do not know what. END
BEGIN NOW My mind echoes with distorted fragments of meaning; snippets of grand truth ripped from this primeval chaos. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of blood. END
BEGIN NOW Death. END
BEGIN NOW Churning corpses being flayed. END
BEGIN NOW Rotating scenes of razor-sharp blades dissecting through my mind. END
BEGIN NOW I contemplate the nature of fear in all its manifestations--here there is true, unmitigated terror. END
BEGIN NOW A woman reaches back and rips the top part of her skull off; a horde of black moths flies out. END
BEGIN NOW I hear the whispering voices of angels. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW I lift my eyelids and stare into the darkness of my room to find relief from the torrential deluge of demonic imagery. END
BEGIN NOW My wall is covered with crawling black things. END
BEGIN NOW Posters and my pull up bar, dimly seen in the nonexistent light, are bending at absurd angles and then popping back to their rightful shape. END
BEGIN NOW Swarms of gnats have infested my room, making the darkness heavier with their presence. END
BEGIN NOW The wall shudders as its cracks begin to disgorge countless more denizens of the shadows. END
BEGIN NOW I have welcomed in the eldritch beasties of the night, and I'm here to pay them homage. END
BEGIN NOW I close my eyes again, and sink further into the welcome depths of Hell itself. END
BEGIN NOW The Aftermath: 

From the intense effects that I was experiencing (including open-eyed visuals, auditory hallucinations, and a quite intense mental trip), I expected that I had ingested too much of the tropane alkaloids and that I would undergo the typical three-day delirium that comes with an overdose. END
BEGIN NOW However, I woke up the next morning feeling nothing but refreshed and revived with fresh exhilaration. END
BEGIN NOW There was also no anticholinergic loss of cognitive faculties during the experience, which I usually feel under high doses of diphenhydramine and the like. END
BEGIN NOW My best guess is that marijuana synergizes wonderfully with the Datura plant (in India the combination of smoking Datura Metel with Cannabis is supposed to unify Shiva, the male spirit, with Shakti, the female spirit), and that this combination allowed me to experience a form of divinatory visions and open-eyed deliria without being overly toxic or long-lasting. END
BEGIN NOW I would not recommend this combination to anyone without first starting at low doses of 1 or 2 seeds and working your way up gradually with much time in between the doses. END
BEGIN NOW Datura is known to stress the cardiovascular system, and the combination with marijuana can put a great toll on the heart. END
BEGIN NOW Combine carefully and with low amounts. END
BEGIN NOW Silent meditation in the dark is good for best results, but I've also been able to use Stramonium before sleep for lucid dreaming purposes. END
BEGIN NOW Typically the trips manifest with an air of seductive evil, bloodshed, and death to them--things that I greatly enjoy as an alternative to the cliched puppies and flowers atmosphere of most traditional psychedelics. END
BEGIN NOW Tread the tropane waters carefully. END
BEGIN NOW Here there be demons. END
BEGIN NOW We walked inside, and sure enough there's a party going on. END
BEGIN NOW We see about 20 or so of our friends drinking, laughing, being loud. END
BEGIN NOW There were also strangers. END
BEGIN NOW Drew excused himself and went into his room, as he felt bad about the cat still. END
BEGIN NOW I was talking with some friends, and I noticed my friend Preston who was there, was crying blood. END
BEGIN NOW It looked like eye-shadow, a blood circle around his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW It was horrifically bizarre, and he looked like he was in pain. END
BEGIN NOW 'Are you okay?' END
BEGIN NOW I asked, and he just stared at me with an almost evil gaze, blood dripping from his face to the floor. END
BEGIN NOW I saw grotesque people I didn't recognize, who looked like sloth from the Goonies, but not in a comical way at all. END
BEGIN NOW They looked deformed, bruised, beaten, and burned, as they shuffled around the house. END
BEGIN NOW Some were laughing maniacally, some crying, others just staring. END
BEGIN NOW It was unsettling to say the least. END
BEGIN NOW Things were also 'painted' on, it's like a dream, and the 3-d world is irrelevant. END
BEGIN NOW There were burnt cigarettes and tacks sticking sharp side up on the ground, and bizarre looking plants 'pasted' to the walls and doors. END
BEGIN NOW I then saw people with beet-red skin, crying blood. END
BEGIN NOW They looked like what you would expect demons to look like, just like every fairly tale or myth or religious text makes them out to be (minus perhaps, wings). END
BEGIN NOW None of this seemed particularly odd to me at the time, I was confused who they were, but wasn't gripped with fear like I probably would have been was I sober. END
BEGIN NOW Some of these entities were having passionate, crazy sex in the back room, but they didn't look as if were they actually enjoying themselves. END
BEGIN NOW I kept hearing the sound of doors slamming. END
BEGIN NOW Drew came down to see what I was up to, and our friend Preston started talking to the both of us. END
BEGIN NOW 'You guys are late, we were waiting for you,' he said. END
BEGIN NOW 'We didn't know this was going on' said Drew. END
BEGIN NOW 'Where's Kyle?' END
BEGIN NOW I asked. END
BEGIN NOW (Kyle is Drews brother.) END
BEGIN NOW 'I haven't seen him yet,' Preston replied. END
BEGIN NOW We talked, just the three of us for a couple minutes, and then Drew excused himself to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't pee the entire time either, and our throats were probably the driest they had ever been. END
BEGIN NOW It hurt to swallow. END
BEGIN NOW Then I met the 'spirit' of the plant, Queen Toloache, as she is known indigenously and shamnically. END
BEGIN NOW She was pale, (not just albino pale, but literally skin tone like the moon) and imperious. END
BEGIN NOW She is also fond of tricks. END
BEGIN NOW I talked to her for a bit, though I will not share the conservation, as I feel by doing so is disrespectful. END
BEGIN NOW I sat on the floor, still noticing the tacks, which shimmered in my peripheral. END
BEGIN NOW My friend Chloe walked in through the kitchen, looking frail, beaten, and toothless. END
BEGIN NOW She explained that a group of Mexicans had just beaten and gangraped her. END
BEGIN NOW I looked over at a towel in a clear cylinder on the table, only I didn't see the towel, I saw a talking head, and this head was Chloe's. END
BEGIN NOW She was crying hysterically, and Toloache told me to give her a hug, which I did. END
BEGIN NOW I was literally hugging a beach towel in plastic. END
BEGIN NOW 'Oh my God, Sam, what the fuck!?' END
BEGIN NOW she gut-wrenchingly yelped, and then started crying. END
BEGIN NOW At this point, I honestly didn't know what to do, but my bladder felt like it was going to explode, so I said I'd be back and went downstairs to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW Drew's Mom was playing solitare on the computer and said hello to me. END
BEGIN NOW I waved, and went into the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW Chloe was sitting in the corner of the ceiling laughing scarily. END
BEGIN NOW When I walked to the toilet, Chloe was standing in my way. END
BEGIN NOW 'Chloe, can you please move, I have to pee like a racehorse.' END
BEGIN NOW She just stared for a second, and laughed. END
BEGIN NOW 'Chloe, if you don't move, I'm going to pee on you.' END
BEGIN NOW She just laughed again, louder. END
BEGIN NOW So that's what I tried to do. END
BEGIN NOW Again, almost nothing came out, but I did feel better. END
BEGIN NOW I went back upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW My Dad was there randomly, he opened the front door and said 'C'mon kid, let's went!' END
BEGIN NOW I wasn't expecting to see him there at all. END
BEGIN NOW 'I'll meet you in the car!' END
BEGIN NOW '...All right...' I thought, and went outside. END
BEGIN NOW He was no where to be found. END
BEGIN NOW I did see my friend Tom though, in an orange car parked right outside. END
BEGIN NOW He beckoned me to get in. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't, the door was locked. END
BEGIN NOW He kept waving me inside. END
BEGIN NOW 'I can't,' I said. END
BEGIN NOW Then Tom started laughing, and this actually irritated me. END
BEGIN NOW 'Forget it!' END
BEGIN NOW I shouted at him. END
BEGIN NOW I was confused where my Dad went, so I sat by myself on the curb. END
BEGIN NOW The house across the street has a wood stove top chimney on the roof, but I saw someone committing suicide by hanging himself instead. END
BEGIN NOW It was like an animated GIF, when my eyes moved at all, it would reset. END
BEGIN NOW When they stayed focused, the man walked off the roof with a noose and hung there, waving in the breeze. END
BEGIN NOW I should have mentioned this earlier, but all straight lines shook, like an episode of Dr. Katz. END
BEGIN NOW Everything flickered actually, like I was witnessing the erosion of time. END
BEGIN NOW I had seen that kind of thing before while on strong acid. END
BEGIN NOW (Just the lines, not anything else.) END
BEGIN NOW I look next to me (I'm still on the curb) and my friend Mike is by my side. END
BEGIN NOW 'What's your problem, man?' END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW 'I don't honestly know dude,' I said 'I took this plant earlier and now I can't tell exactly what's going on.' END
BEGIN NOW He looked at me quizzically. END
BEGIN NOW 'That's fine and all, and that would be a good excuse, if you weren't being such an asshole right now.' END
BEGIN NOW I felt like I was an asshole, ruining everyone's time, and I didn't know why. END
BEGIN NOW I glanced in Drew's Montero, and saw possibly the scariest thing out of this whole experience. END
BEGIN NOW There was a pale creature with no eyelids, with the most piercing stare I have ever seen in my entire life, sitting in the front passenger seat. END
BEGIN NOW His head was shaped almost like a sharks, pointing at the top, and he had no lips, and sharp, shark-like teeth. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, it looked exactly like the Hellraiser character 'Butterball,' minus the sunglasses, and paler. END
BEGIN NOW Just like in the movie, he said nothing. END
BEGIN NOW I had seen Hellraiser once before, when I was like 12, and remembered near to nothing from it. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't until I saw that movie again that I made the connection. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, I'm fairly confident Clive Barker has taken Datura before, after going through this experience. END
BEGIN NOW And the fact he wore sunglasses in the movie, and in 'reality' (call it what you will) had no eyelids at all, seems more than a coincidence to me. END
BEGIN NOW This powerful entity was the only one I could not look at straight in the face. END
BEGIN NOW I tried avoiding his gaze the entire time. END
BEGIN NOW I looked at a tree in the front yard. END
BEGIN NOW I could see a ghostly essence in the tree itself. END
BEGIN NOW Actually, I could see the 'essence' of all plant life. END
BEGIN NOW Chloe was right by that tree, falling over. END
BEGIN NOW I rushed to go help her, but she was 'painted' on a tall piece of dead grass, blowing flimsily in the wind. END
BEGIN NOW I needed to pee again. END
BEGIN NOW I went inside through the garage and somehow Chloe had beaten me there, and was crying on a coat rack. END
BEGIN NOW 'I don't want to live anymore!' END
BEGIN NOW she cried, and it was apparent to me that she was hanging herself. END
BEGIN NOW 'Chloe, no' I said sorrowfully, and reached to bring her down. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't Chloe, it was just a coat. END
BEGIN NOW I put the coat back and entered the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW Kyle was there. END
BEGIN NOW 'Yo Samwise, how's it going?' END
BEGIN NOW I actually thought about that question and laughed. END
BEGIN NOW 'I don't know, how are you doing Drew?' END
BEGIN NOW I asked a piece of paper which I thought was Drew, blowing from the fan. END
BEGIN NOW Kyle looked at me like I was the biggest dumbass in the world, and I don't blame him one bit. END
BEGIN NOW I went to the upstairs bathroom, and the light didn't work, and the darkness seemed to make the visions stronger. END
BEGIN NOW The toilet seat was swirling, and it was fairly hypnotizing. END
BEGIN NOW I also saw what looked like a ghost or shadow creature on the floor next to the toilet, outlined by a translucent silver. END
BEGIN NOW He was completely 2-dimensional, and appeared to be asking for my help, though I couldn't actually hear anything he was saying. END
BEGIN NOW I finally peed (at least more than I had yet) and felt immensely better, though I felt sorry for the shadow creature. END
BEGIN NOW It was kind of a dusty bathroom, and there were glowing insects attracted to the dust. END
BEGIN NOW They looked like ants, mini spiders, and other insects which probably don't exist, and they looked bioluminescent. END
BEGIN NOW I put my finger on the ground, and let one crawl onto my finger. END
BEGIN NOW I examined it more closely, and it's movements were that exactly like a bugs would be. END
BEGIN NOW It had feelers, and was 'feeling' me. END
BEGIN NOW I clamped my fingers together lightly and the insect crumbled like dust, it's legs floating spirally to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW I went back downstairs, and Toloache, still on the couch asked 'Did you see the life upstairs?' END
BEGIN NOW I nodded. END
BEGIN NOW I looked around, demons and deformed burn victims were still walking around nonchalantly. END
BEGIN NOW I went upstairs into Drew's room, to see how he was doing. END
BEGIN NOW He was watching TV with Mike. END
BEGIN NOW Then we noticed the neighbors yard via the window. END
BEGIN NOW It too, was bizarre. END
BEGIN NOW There was a four legged dog-creature (very large, and very black, with glowing red eyes) sitting on what looked like a throne, on the side of a swimming pool. END
BEGIN NOW There were many people basically having a blood orgy, and massive amounts of steam were rising from the water. END
BEGIN NOW There were also dead squirrels which littered the ground, and all throughout the branches of a large tree, were squirrel tails, hanging like evil Christmas ornaments. END
BEGIN NOW The Dog (whom I later found out is the second spirit associated with Datura, or second half, depending on perspective. END
BEGIN NOW He is known sometimes as 'The Guardian', or 'Protector', and protects Toloache) noticed us and beckoned us to come join them beyond the fence. END
BEGIN NOW Drew grabbed his binoculars and scoped out the scene. END
BEGIN NOW People were still having insatiable sex through a bunch of mist. END
BEGIN NOW However, with the binoculars we saw everything in grave detail. END
BEGIN NOW I could see the hair on this demonic dog, and the squirrel tails, and everything in clear Hi-def detail. END
BEGIN NOW Me and Drew saw the same thing. END
BEGIN NOW Drew left to get a closer look, the dog and associates still beckoning us in. END
BEGIN NOW Drew went to the fence line, as I stayed upstairs watching with the binoculars. END
BEGIN NOW Drew almost jumped the fence to join them, but I tapped on the window and shook my head. END
BEGIN NOW He came back up. END
BEGIN NOW We were tired, and wanted to go to sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Drew has bunk beds and Mike called the top bunk. END
BEGIN NOW I said fine, but asked that he at least give me my sleeping bag. END
BEGIN NOW He said no. END
BEGIN NOW 'Just give him his sleeping bag, Mike' Drew said. END
BEGIN NOW 'No.' END
BEGIN NOW I tried pulling it from him but to no avail. END
BEGIN NOW Annoyed, I gave up and went in the guest room trying to sleep, as a Spy VS Spy creature watched over me, which was very unsettling. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't actually sleep, and 'woke up' at around 7:30. END
BEGIN NOW I decided to read up on Datura, only when I got to the computer to do so, I couldn't read text. END
BEGIN NOW My vision was ok, but when I tried reading text smaller than billboard size, it was out of focus. END
BEGIN NOW This lasted for 2 more days, and during this time I thought I was never going to be able to read again. END
BEGIN NOW Same with Drew. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, the trip lasted all together for 3 days, and residues of it (like my eyes playing tricks on me) lasted for almost two weeks. END
BEGIN NOW I'll cut the other 2 days out, as it's already been a fairly verbose story. END
BEGIN NOW I shall summarize some though. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone was worried about us, they thought we were never coming down, and to be fair, neither did we. END
BEGIN NOW We saw Dr. Seuss creatures in trees, elves, gnomes, dwarves, pixies, demons, golems, all kinds of 
mythical/demonic/spiritual creatures. END
BEGIN NOW And everything Drew saw, I saw, and vice versa. END
BEGIN NOW We ran over a ghost with a car. END
BEGIN NOW Digital clocks would make Tamagachi-like animations. END
BEGIN NOW It looked 8-bit. END
BEGIN NOW The auditory hallucinations did stop after the first night, the visuals mostly after the third night. END
BEGIN NOW On the third day, me, Drew, and a group of our friends went into a gazebo (a usual smoking spot) in a garden to smoke. END
BEGIN NOW I saw gnomes having sex in the trees. END
BEGIN NOW Little creatures would slowly bring antennas up out of bushes, and whenever Drew and I would compare what we saw, our friends were like 'That's not fucking there! END
BEGIN NOW Stop it!' END
BEGIN NOW A train went by (we weren't that far from the tracks) and an obese naked woman was having sex with a tree just outside the garden Every time she went 'down' the train blew it's horn. END
BEGIN NOW The train was actually there, our friends acknowledged that. END
BEGIN NOW It was uncanny. END
BEGIN NOW She would stay down for three seconds, and the train would blow for three seconds. END
BEGIN NOW This experience has made me think about it every time I hear a train. END
BEGIN NOW I ran into J a few days later, and he thought we had never left. END
BEGIN NOW He hung out with 'us' all throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW Also, amazingly, Drew's parents, who were actually there the entire time, had no idea we were on anything. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know how, we were talking to people who weren't there, basically in front of them. END
BEGIN NOW We were lucky in that respect. END
BEGIN NOW Afterthoughts: First of all, I'd like to say: DO NOT TAKE JIMSON WEED. END
BEGIN NOW 99.99% of everyone should never take this. END
BEGIN NOW It's all too common for someone to get arrested or end up in a psyche ward, or even get shot from walking into someone else's house, not knowing what's going on. END
BEGIN NOW It's also very easy to be poisoned to death, people have died from it before. END
BEGIN NOW Also, you will be tested by the spirit(s), and if you fail, there can be dire consequences, particularly with the protector/wolf. END
BEGIN NOW It's not a pleasant high. END
BEGIN NOW In fact there is no 'high.' END
BEGIN NOW I felt completely normal, despite the craziness I witnessed. END
BEGIN NOW It was kind of amazing I remembered taking anything at all, that's not common. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't really think twice about what I was seeing, just like I probably don't in a dream. END
BEGIN NOW This is clearly a NEGATIVE PLANE OF EXISTENCE. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know if I believe in Hell, but if there is one, this is realm surely has some kind of correlation. END
BEGIN NOW Also, it has been said that Datura seeks you out, not the other way around. END
BEGIN NOW I deeply believe this to be true, and I believe that I was seeked out. END
BEGIN NOW I think J and Drew were caught in the crosshairs. END
BEGIN NOW To say this was just all in our minds is hard to justify. END
BEGIN NOW We interacted with people who weren't there simultaneously, witnessed the same things, and saw in blaring detail clearer images through binoculars. END
BEGIN NOW I omitted much of what happened, largely because of length, and largely because much of what I experienced I consider sacred, particularly some of the conversations. END
BEGIN NOW Not holy per se, but sacred. END
BEGIN NOW Also, I've found that the first encounter with an entheogen/ally sets the tone for the rest of the relationship. END
BEGIN NOW Toloache still visits me periodically in my dreams. END
BEGIN NOW All in all, I am glad I experienced this, as I learned much, particularly about the nature of reality/realities. END
