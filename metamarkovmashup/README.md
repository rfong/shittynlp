metamarkovmashup
======
messy collection of scripts via which I generated content for [@bookofdatura](https://twitter.com/bookofdatura)

right now these are just normal markov mashup scripts; the "meta" part will occur if I ever make this into a web app that automates the mashing up better than manually running a script

usage
-----
for now you probably want to run ./mmm2.sh on two plaintext corpora

todo
-----
+ organize the raw data and chains somewhere
+ make it a web app
+ add some metric to evaluate what corpora are good to mashup together (for example, shared vocabulary and similar grammatical tendencies)
